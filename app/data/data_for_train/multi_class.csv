There are two different points of view: sportsmen should not be allowed to do any sport about 2 years or athletes must not participate in various competitions for the whole their lives. Both points of view are aceptable and now we are going to discuss them.
First of all, there are too many sport scandals and the major part of them are conected with illegal drugs. International organisations try to overcome them and the basic method is banneding atheletes for 2 years. It is believed that after this period they will be free and clear and will not any aftermaths. Eventually sportsmen can continue their careers. 
On the other hand, influention of drugs are spoiled health and competitions for sportsmen after drugs-scandle are unavalable. It should be said that if they use drugs once, they will do it again. According to statistics, people could not to stop and apply with drugs for the rest of ther lives.
For my opinion, illegal drugs-scandles should be solved by government and bounded any drugs in sports and competitions at all. Also it is not esential to discualificate athelets for the rest of teir lives, because they participates in competitions and do sports from the shildhood. Sport is the sense of their lives.
In to conclude, there is only one view and it is important, that government should prevent sportsmen from drugs. Moreover, sports organisation should not abouned atheletes for whole life.

Nowadays the problem is even more relevant than ever before, because governments are failing to tackle the problem via strong punishments and extra restrictions. That’s why the society should develop new approaches to the problem solution, based on positive influence of parents and teachers.
Let’s try to list the main reasons for crimes commited by children and teenagers and think how those crimes should be prevented. Some children might be engaged in stealing or robbery because they don’t have enough money to fulfill their needs and desires. Parents should definetely try to give their children an opportunity to earn their pocket money. Doing household chores or walking with a dog will not only bring a child a couple dollars but also teach him or her that money should be earned by labor.
Others might feel lack of understanding and love from their parents or classmates. Parents and teachers should talk to children, help them to build communication with other people. A person who is able to make true friends and who knows that he or she is surrounded by love and care is less likely to commit a crime.
The last reason which we will mention is permanent stress children and teens face in their everyday lives. Fear of flunking an exam, quarelling with parents might cause negative psychological effects and aggression finding its way out through violence and even crimes. Teachers should be very attentive to such students and provide them with a help of professional psychologist, if necessary. In other words, the best solution to problem doesn’t lie in the field of tough punishments and the strictest laws. We should try to smooth the process of socialization and growing instead. Being able to earn some money, make friends and having support in tough times will significantly decrease the incentives to break the law.

However, not all people support this idea, because they think that there are other more effective measures to maintain the health of the people.


In my opinion, sport facilities can have a certain effect on health level of the society. It is true that sport prevents people from negative effects, such as obesity, but it can not cope with cancer or AIDS. And there is no scientific proof that sport helps to prevent regular diseases. Generally, the sport and sport facilities are necessary for the public, but sport should not be regarded as a multi-objective healthcare subject. Yes, it will prevent a person from having a heart strike, but, as it is before mentioned, the range of the correlation between sport and general preservation of diseases is to small.


What is more important, to my mind, is how to prevent the children the children mortality and children diseases. Many diseases which a child can catch when he is young, can affect his health for the whole life, because the disease can learn how to cope with the immune system, so children are more defenceless to this issue.


There are few more ways to maintain the level of the public health. It is important to have a proper nutrition, e.g eating only natural food, and restrain from taking alcohol, tobacco, fast food, salt and other potentially dangerous products. Also, vitamins are worthy taking them because they help to balance all processes in the human body.


In conclusion, it is important to say, that not only sport is important, but the general health culture is what may help the society to stay fit and not to get sick.

It is a huge problem, when people copy films or music and share it in the internet. Such situation is very costly for the film studios and musicians. Some people consider that people, who download films and music for free from the internet, instead of buying original discs in a shop, should be punished. There are some arguments against this point of view.
Firstly, the illegal pirate copies of films and music appear in the internet after the premier of the film in cinemas. In some situations, the pirate copies appeared in the internet 2 weeks after the film started in cinemas. In 2 weeks the producers of this film usually can gain a lot of money from cinemas and usually the amount of money is more that a budget of the film. Moreover, the quality f pirate copies is often bad, with awful sound and dark picture. That’s why a lot of people prefer to buy licensed discs. In this logic, police shouldn’t arrest people, who share files.
Then, it can be easily seen, that the governments of the different countries all over the world try to ban web-sites in the internet, where people can download pirate copies of films. But this policy of blocking web-sites doesn’t work, because there are a lot of hackers, who can hack the system and continue to share illegal files. If police catch one hacker, there will be another one. This is a “circle”, and there is no way to break it.
In conclusion there should be said, that people will always share illegal films and music. In this way, the musicians and film producers should make qualitative content. If they make good films, people will visit cinemas instead of downloading films from the internet.

I am completely agree that people who download such files should be punished, but there are some advantages and disadvantages of this situation which I will discuss in this essay. 

For the one hand, pirate copies allow poor people who have no opportunity to buy original discs to download and to enjoy music or films. For some people it is the only chance to know cinema trends and popular musicians. They have no way in that situation and no possible solutions. 

For the other hand, it is a complete break of author’s rules. In this case such theft should be punished by tax. Futhermore, there is another problem of pirate copies. People who download copies are risking to catch a virus on their computer or tablet. It is definitely a big problem and a cause why pirate copies should be prohibited. One more disadvantage of sharing pirate copy is losing money by producers and creators of music or films. 

There are advantages and disadvantages of using pirate copies. Moreover, it is a theft, but it seems to me that it should be punished by tax instead of strong punishment. Also musicians and film producers can create mote copies of their discs, for example, and try to solve it with the lowest price. It can be one of the possible solution in that situation.

That is why people make significant portion of contribution to searching ways to cope with existed situation. It was proven that air transport pollutes the atmosphere more noticeably than other means of transport. So then a lot of people firmly believe that governments should limit air travelling by low restrictions. As for me I totally disagree with above-mentioned view point.
To begin with it is worth mentioning that air travelling has lots of benefits that cannot be substituted by other more or less environmnentalal friendly means of transports. First of all I would point out the time economy which is relevant to be emphasized as one of the proses of air transportation. Law restrictions aimed to limit this sphere  will definitely cause more negative consequences than positive ones. Firstly it will affect the export contribution into governments budjet because such transportation of production will not be possible anymore. It will be caused by limitations of business travelling because mainly consensus concerning exported or imported production can be reachd during formal meeting located in the owner's country. Thus social level of life will fall by the reason of the absence of enough resources.  Finally leisure is as much important as business because it remains level of life stable. People who have opportunity to have a rest in other country have ability to compare and afterwards they work more efficiently and increase the level of productivity. 
However there are some opposite opinions that should be taken into consideration as well. Some people are convinced that above-mentioned problems caused by air travelling limitations do not overweight the consequences of air pollution. Some of them think that we are able to challenge such inconveniences in honour of our future life. Moreover we should think about our future generations and we are responsible for their life conditions.
But as for me future generations can be saved by lots of other ways. I have already proved that in most cases air travelling cannot be substituted. That is why we ought to consider other methods of saving environment involving the contribution of every single person. We should doubtles start the mission of saving the word from ourselves and our own habits.
To put everything in a nutshell I would conclude that limiting air travelling is not the most profitable idea due to wide range of significant negative consequences. There is a great amount of other ways to save the environment we need to focus on.

But in the other hand it might be not the best solution for concept  many solution. The mobility of modern society became a really important part of our live. And it can be a little bit silly to try to stop this global movement. Maybe we should try to find out other solutions to avoid air pollutions and global warming. For example, such as the improvement of our technologies, we might try to find the faster way for transportation which will not influence on our nature. As a conclusion, I think that air travel affecting air pollution and global warming is a really important problem and subject for discussion. But there might be some other ways to solve this problem than to limit air travel in my opinion the best way is in the new technology apportunities.

Other say that this would not have a significant effect on the public health and there are better ways to reach it.


To begin with, which results can give the increasing the number of sport facilities. First of all, people prefer different type of sport. Some people like tennis, others like football. If we want to improve public health by increasing sport facilities, we would to build wide different facilities. Then all people can find for themselves the lovely type of sport. 


There are another ways to reach the improving of public health. To begin with government and social organisation should develop the medicine. The high level of medicine. Can provide the high level of public health. If people can get qualified help from medical workers and all medical centre will have a different types of new technology, then public healt will rise.


As for me, in my opinion, every way of improving public health is good. But we should pay attention, that we can get the best results if we combine these ways. In this case, people will take a part in different types of sport to increase own health, but people, who feel disease frequently should be deal with sport under looking of medical workers.

Some people believe that such travelling harms the ecosystem, others argue that it is imperative that air travelling remains the same and I can understand their point of view. First of all, air travelling is the most efficient way to travel ling distance with the minimum amount of emission into the atmosphere and maximum number of passengers transported. If governments can air travelling or introducing a tax that will make flying unaffordable, people will search other means to travel, which may turn out to be more dangerous to our planet, for example, more cars will be used thus increasing the amount of carbon monoxide in the air. What is more, sometimes air travelling is the only way to get to a specific location, for example, spizbergen or other islands it will take ages to get from spizbergen to main land via ship travelling, non with starding that some ships are not meant to be sailing in cold water icebergs. Moreover, Rescue Teams also use aircraft to quickly transport injured people to the emergency rooms in hospitals or to help firefighters conquer the forest fires. Despite all these fact, some people strongly believe that governments should take action and deal with the amount of air travels in order to protect the environment. Some argue that if you want to travel for pleasure or business you should pay more. It seems that higher prices will commute the damage to the environment. They also think that people will remain within their social areas or their own country and that that with the higher payments less people will travel worldwide. It goes without saying that while some part of this argument is true it is doubtful that air travel will be reduced dramatically, while it is obvious that other means of transport such as cars or trains will be used more, as the result more energy will be consumed and more harmful goes will be thrown in the air. All in all, the issue of restricting air travelling still needs to be thoroughly considered, but I believe that restricting air travelling is not a wise move as it may turn out to be counter productive and consequently, lead to negative results.

The questio is if it is beneficial to us, humans to travel by planes or we have to reduce the amount of air travel as it will to a disaster in future. 

I agree with the position that air travel and the usage of planes should be reduced. First of all, the ecological situation on our earth is cticical. We destroy forests which produce oxygen for our lives and which can filtrate and reduce the proportion of harmful gases and CO2 in the atmosphere. And when we travel by plane, we make an extra pollution which can lead to some ozon holes in the atmosphere which can destroy the life on the earth. Secondly, there are thousands of planes in the air each second. Some of them are even without passangers or half-full with them which also leads to extra pollution without any sceme.


However, some people claim that cars and factories produce much more pollution and planes are more ecofriendly then other transport because there are no so many of them. I disagree with such people because in comparison with 20 years ago, today there are much more planes and plane manufacturs still want to better the characteristics of their products but not to reduce their emissions.

To sum up, I am sure that we should reduce and controll air travelling because it is too harmful for our planet. I think that the best way to reduce emitions is to make eco-friendly planes.

For instant, children even can become a murder at the age of 15 because they want to be noticed. I consider that it is really importatnt and grown-ups should help young people who has such thoughts.The second reason is different movies about violence and crime.They give children an understanding about the fact that to be a robber or a murder it is normal and then at the everything will be OK , but it is a movie, in real life it is much more serious.

I really believe that parents and teachers need to fight with these causes for example they should respect the children, try them to understand what is good and bad, pay attention to them to everyone individual method of behavior, especially if young person have some problems in family or at school and also go to psychologist with him and not allow to watch TV being a small child.

In my point of view, I am sure that adults need to help youth to deal with their problems and then I guess the youth crimes will be reduced. Moreover, it is also a duty to the government to help children since they go to school by including a program at school which is about how to behave and make them do different acvivities which take their time and they will not even think about doing something awfull.",6

However it contributes great harm to the nature, especially to air, that it is why some people believe that goverments should control the traffic of air travelling by special laws. I strongly agree with this point of view and in this essay I will explain why.

First of all, almost all modern scientists are very worried about ecological situation in the world. In order to save our planet many organizations try to control air pollution by different methods. In this case, it is important to use the power of government for helping our Earth. If governments introduce special laws, it will support ecological organizations in fighting with pollution and global warming very much.

Moreover, the main goal of the government is to care about people. In this case, it is try to make everything to provide more pure atmosphere and clean air. This changes will positively influence on the level of health and amount of births.

Finally, controlling the traffic of planes by government will show people the real situation in worldwide ecology system. Everyone will understand that this problem went to a new level – level of the President. It will motivate people to be more careful: keep the air clean and do not make streets dirty.

To conclude, air pollution and global warming is one of the main issues of a modern society. In order to save the ecological situation governments should try any methods include introducing special laws for air-companies.

Unlike the desktop, the number of mobile users almost was doubled from 55 millions to 95 millions per year. It can be seen from the second bar chart tht men and women have a different aims for exploring Facebook. For example, about 54% of men prefer sending media, such as photo and video, meanwhile only 39% of women do. As can be observed getting updates is equally popular among both men and women. However, using Facebook for fun and learning about possibilities to help others is still more typical for men.

Manufactured goods are delivered by rail and road in a huge amount and make up 25% and 28%, respectively. The enormous difference can bee seen in food products that constitute 30% of goods transported by road while rail transportations of food are three times less.

According to that fact, two points of view appeard: one people believe that it is right to ban such athletes from competing for a limited period, while others insist on banning them for the rest of their lives. Both views are popular nowadays, but who is right?
First of all, we should research how the use of illegal drugs affects human organism. People, who stand for permanent ban often claim that drugs cause changes in human health, that cannot be reversed. So even those sportsmen, who used to do drugs but then stopped have a serious benefits and can show better results than those who never even tried illegal drugs. According to that, it is undebatable, that we should ban those people, but if it is not right, we don't have a clear reason to disqualify them for the rest of their lifes.
Never the less, it is obvious than people who use illegal drugs to win controdict the idea of competitive sport itself, where everyone is eiqual and training an will age the most important things to succeed. I do not think, that we should allow people, who once betrayed the idea of sport, to take part in competition. On the other hand, just as any criminal can change and be the normal member of society, sportsmen who were cought on doing drugs should be given a chanse to change their attitude to sport.
And the last, but not the least is the fact, that not everyone who uses illegal drugs even know about it. There are some cases, when sportsmen were treated with drugs by their trainers or even doctors without even understending it. So, according to this, we can't know if someone used drugs by his will or not, so punishment should not be permanent.
To sum up, I'd like to say, that there is no doubt that using illegal drugs is a serious crime in sport, but we can't ban people permanently without knowing every aspect of their situation, which is impossible.

Internet, social media, social networks are important are important part of human life. With help of them people could communicate. Watch news and videos. Improvements of hi-teck has not all positive, but also negative sides. With help of social networks and web-sites people all around the world could copy films and music and watch or hear it illegal.
There are two main points of view. The first is supported by musicians, actors and producers, which loose money from piracy in internet. They spend money for creating films and music and they want to earn more. There were many situations, when pirates downloaded films in internet before the premier and film-makers lost some money because people watched it in internet. Some pirates created online cinemas, where people could see films free. Pirates earned money from advertising.  Film-makers and lingers think, that the government schould control the internet and protect property rights of people, who create films and music.
There is also opposite point of view, which is supported by some internet-users and politicians in western countries. They think, that government or police couldn’t affect on internet, because it is free and private space for people all changed the world. Film makers and producers want to earn more money, but people mustn’t pay for their mistakes. Also internet-activists think, that some producers are simply greedy and because of that they want destroy the rules of global network. In many european countries Ycealand, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Finland and other created pirate-parties. These anti-sistem movements protest against the rights of capitalism and global market. Activists from these parties supported internet users and thought that all people all around the world have the right to make in internet everything, that they want. Some of these parties won parlament seats in Europe.
To conclude, I’ed like to say, that producers or film-creators and internet users must create an agreement, which would not only protect their property rights, but also will be comfortable for internet users. If creators will download their intellectual property in internet and users will pay not so much money for it, it would be practically comfortable not only for singers and film-creators, but also for internet-users. Of course, it is not easy to reach the compromise between these communities, but if they would like to fiant the negotiations, it will be useful for all people – for creators and for users.

Therefore, musicians, movie producers lose huge parts of income every year because of illegal practicies, so there is an opinion that people who download pirate copies should be punished.
First of all, there are some arguments against this point of view. Firstly, a lot of people just do not have so much money to pay for every disc with new song or film and the only solution for them is to download pirate copies. Secondly, practicies can be beneficial for musician: information about him or her, his song are spread through the internet and his popularity grows up. Last but not least, a lot of people simply do not know that they download illegal pirate files so it is hard to blame them.
However, there are some people who agree with this opinion and believe that punishement for downloading pirate copies should be. First of all, they claim that a lot of films do not receive a great popularity in cinemas just because of possibility to watch them on the internet illegally. Secondly, pirate copies usually have bad quality and viruses inside them, which can lead to breakaning computers and stealing money and personal information. Thirdly, if one does not know the laws it does not mean that he should be considered as innocent.
All in all, one should keep in mind these arguments and remember that, despite the advantages of downloading pirate copies, such practicies are formally illegal.

People spend all their spare time sitting in front of their monitor, watening movies and eating snacks which consist of high-calorie ingredients.

However, all these issues can be solved. Less time should be spent in front of the computer, business discussion can be conducted in person instead of Skype conferences.

Moreover, influence of modern movies, stresses connected with reusing of a computer must be reduced by natural communication with natural people and healthy eating.

Nowadays air pollution and global warmimg, which can be named expected results of regular air travel, appear to be widely discussed by both citizens and governments. Whether the amount of air travel should be reduced by legal measures is a controversial question worth discussing.
Some people claim that introducing laws which decrease the amount of trips made by air transport means is a proof of overreacting and not being able to suggest an actual solution of this issue, which is an opinion I share. To begin with, while air travel does contribute to air pollution and global warming, it is not the main souce of the issues and there are other spheres to be noticed by concerned people. Moreover, with the introduction of such laws getting to another place by air would turn out to be much more difficult and take more time and money, which can have bad consequences when an immediate need to travel appears. In addition, extreme contorl of the air travel sphere might result badly in terms of jobs and burocraty.
However, there are people who believe that providing laws to contorl and specifically reduce air travel regularity is absolutely necessary. Firstly, it is the governments' responsibility to step up when a world-wide issue has reached a crucial condition. Secondly, it is imeprative that some actions in the ecology sphare are taken and a possible decrease in the amount of air travel is a practical first step in this course. Thirdly, this idea might increase people's awareness of the issua and make them consider more advantages and disadvantages for ecology when making a decision to travel by air.
In conclusion, the possibility of introducing such laws seems to be drawing people's attention for a number of reasons; with heated discussions of the issue such measure would be not advised until more detailed agreements are reached. Hopefully, in the future a solution will appear that will not include making unnecessary barriers for people willing and/or in need to travel by air.",7

And stress causes many arguments and the things can even come to the extreamely frtustrative situations. When people speak about crime the word that comes in their minds is ""the youth"". Saddly, but crime rate amoung young people is higher than ever.Their environment and the society tells them what to do and how to bee ""cool"" in someway.

The first argument is that most of them are rejected by society and to attrackt attention - they commit absurd things to say ""I'm different"".

The second argument is that young people are easily affected. The most of them see and advertising, for exaple, and they want to buy it immediately. They don't think about the consequences, but just take what they want even if it's sometimes illigally.

Thirdly, the young people's problem is sometimes ignorance. They think that they don't need the elder generation's advices and that they need to have their own experiences, but sometimes these very experiences drive to the road of drugs, guns and conflits not because they wanted to, but because of the lack of knowlegde and a massive ignorance and too much self-confidence.

To solve this problem there's the only way: education. As from parents, as from school. They must be taught how to love, how to normally communicate with people. How to make friends and one of the things that must be deffinitely taught is how to take decisions. Because many of them almost always listen to their feelings while it would be better to face these kind of things with a sense of rationality. Yhey firstly may be angry but the shoul think a lot before doing or saying something.

What is also harmful is that mobile phones are held too close to the eyes while using, which is even worse for them. The most obvious solution to this health problem is to get rid of its cause, in other words, to use mobile phones less. But the world is developing so rapidly that it is not really possible, since phones have become a big part of the lives. Another way to improve sight or to prevent it from getting worse is to make different exercises for the relaxation of the eyes' muscles.

In addition, the use of devices often cause headaches because of the huge spread of formation. Our brain cannot recycle al the information we receive. So it could be useful t to filter what we read, watch or listen to or to take only necessary information that you need at the current moment. 

In conclusion, modern technologies are not something bad. We cannot decline their utility however we should have some limits of their using. Our organs and health mustn’t suffer from devices.

The only exception was the number of girls in South Asia which fall four times since 2000. Overall, the data indicates that here were sharp changes in the number of boys and girls without access to primary education during the period of 12 years.

Starting with people aged 30 and above, it drastically falls in popularity, with only one quarter of adults aged 30-49 using it, and then dropping to roughly 10% for adults aged 50 and above.

This trend is reversed with LinkedIn. Young people do not use it as much as they use Facebook or Instagram, with only 22 percent of adults aged 18-29 reporting that they use it.

For example, from 45 to 54 years woman spent about 70 minuts on sport, while man are doing sport in 2 times more.
As may be concluded from the chart, with the age people spent less their time on sport and to 75 years old they nearly ended doing the exercises.

It is obvious that this situation is caused mostly by two factors: the weight of products to be transported and the time in which they should be delivered. For example, such goods as chemicals and food products spoil clearly faster than metals and machinery. That is why it is better to take them to a place by road, which clearly takes less time.

Secondly, government can encourage such action by putting taxes on flight. For example, if someone travel a lot, he must pay for each extra flight more that previous.

Some people belive that air travel make much air pollution and is the reason of global warming, so they argue that we need reduce the amount of air travel to avoid natures problems. Other people say that we need to try to find scintific way to decline air pollution from plan, without changing amount of air travel. I fully agree with the second group.
First of all, I supose that people mast have an apportunity to travel because it help us to travel. I mean that, it is a chance for tourist visit all over the world, learn new cultures, broaden their horisens. For example, Airplane is the best way foe man, who live in Sibiria, where weather is cold full time, visit sunshine beach.
The second reason, why I strongly belive that we really need in Air travel is access to other countries experience in medicine of business. According to the statistic a lot of people with some horible diseases can get cvalificate help only in japan. For example, so they must travel only by airplane because it is the faster way to japan from UK, for example.

In addition to this we willose chance to get cvalificate help from other countries. Thats all lead to sharp decrease of living standarts.

This may be caused by things like poverty, lack of education, physical and mental abuse, violent computer games, etc. This essay will discuss possible approaches for parents and teachers to be taken to solve this problem.
Firstly, the responsibility of raising the young generation lies with their parents. Making sure that their child is not involved in violent or abusive activities is crucial in this case. Parents should monitor the types of computer games their children play. Knowing who their child is friends with is also necessary, because peers often shape each other's mindsets, which sometimes results in seemingly quiet kids being involved in bullying or any kind of activities that include violence.
Secondly, since teachers are those who the children spend most of their days with, they are also participating in the forming of future generations. It is essential for teachers to crack down on anything that can provoke violence or be a cause of it inside the class. Becoming the child's friend and knowing their strengths and weaknesses would help them create a bond of love and respect, thus forming an individual that is law obeying and respectful to the other people.
Finally, both the parents and the teachers are the main role models for children, thereby being a lawful and considerate individual in the eyes of the child is essential.
In conclusion, it is the responsibility of the adults to solve the problem of growing rate of crime among young people. To be loving, caring and attentive to chidlren, to be a positive role model for them to look up to, are the best methods of solving this problem.",8

Some people may argue such a system can be beneficial for the society, while others believe it may be even harmful. I suppose this issue requieres more careful consideration.

On the one hand, if a ""Guaranteed basic income"" system is organised, it will have certain advantages. Firstly, every person will be prevented from absolute poverty, as they will receive minimal income on a monthly basis.For instance, they can spend this money to buy products or to pay for rent. Secondly, such an idea will be beneficial for home-staying mothers, especially for those who are the only breadwinners in the family, because they sometimes struggle to find a job. Furthermore, this system is to help elderly people and teenagers to become more independent from other members of their family.

On the other hand, when people receive money regardless of the situation, they may face several problems. First of all, the government will need to increase taxes to compensate the money which were spent from the budget. Moreover, people might feel deprived of the impulse to find a job or a better job, as they will be financially secure. Nevertheless,the desire to improve the quality of life usually maintaines the same level in any society.

To conclude, although implemention of this system may have several drawbacks, it is likely to provide citezens with a necessary sum of money, which sometimes can save their lives and even make them better. Therefore, I suppose advantages of this system will outweigh the drawbacks.",7

However, other people claim that it will not help and drug market will developes any way and sportsmen will try to avoid the punishments.

Moreover, people think that sportsmen must be banned for a limited period because all people make mistakes and they can change. Nevertheless, the second group says that it not professional. In my opinion, limited period is more humanly, and it is great, however, I am in favour that this problem must be soluted at once.
In addition, people for limited punishment think that only one mistake would be a reason to inability to develope of sport sphere because lots of talented sportsmen could not take part in competitions.

But I definitely disagree with such position and I’ll explain why.
Firstly, free information sharing is a very important factor in a cultural development as for every particular person, as for society as an infity. By watching for listening to products discussed we obtain huge material for analyzing and reflecting. We may become emotionally fulfill and we may get a very profound knowledge of who are we and where are we going. Can it be possible to imagine our world without Beatles? Weren’t they some kind of a voice of generation common symbol? Yes, they were. And was imagine what would happen, if access to their art were hardly restricted, if so-called pirates were punished for such dynamic “illegal” sharing? Would you support such restrictions?
Secondly, as for as I’m concerned, every artist wants his work to be seen and valued. It is not about money, but about self-expression, self-manifestation if you want to call it 10. And Internet, free sharing, pirates – all mentioned allows creators directly communicate with their potential (and non-potential) authority, with those who could understand them. Capitalist login of investments and incomes do not work in such case musical label, midue-concernt do act in a role of giant parazyte.
To conclude; I’ll say that free share is a mechanism which helps not only public, but to an author as well. It their needs and ambitions, perfectly and encourages development dynamic of both of them. So if we must choose between general good and pragmatic material interests of firms and companies, I will undoubtly choose the first option.

In last years we became witness of several scandals connected to using illegal drugs by athletes. In this essay we will compare two different opinions about punishment for those athletes.
On the right hand, everyone can make mistake and choose incorrected way. The ban for several years it's a good lesson and leave a chance for sportsmens to start a new life without mistakes from past. It's important because sometimes using illegal drugs is not own athlete's decision. In history was times when sportsmen was pressed by his trainers. They makes this athletes to choose drugs. On the other hand the ban from sports for the rest of sportsmen's lifes is a justice decision because using drugs can change their bodies forever. and sportsmens never able to ready for fair competitions. For example some medicenes leave organizm a very long time. And another important cause is that once unfair person stole the prize and now we haven't evidences that he will not try to do this again.

People download films in the Internet because of that they do not go to cinemas for premieras. They prefer watch it in home, where they do not pay money for tickets. I agree that sharing the product should be punched. There is a huge illigal industry wich have money when sharing media product before official date of release because of views in the Net. There are groups in social media with illigal content having big audience, and they sharply rise.

That is why its improving is reguarded as a chief goal of every country and every government. The increasing of sport facilities is one of the methods to do this. Yet, some other people think that the range of measures is wider and sport development is not enough to achieve the goal. So, let us think it over.


First of all, the development of sport can encourage teenagers to refuse their bad habbits like drinking alcohol and smoking and to show them a better way of their personal development. This somewhat determines the improving of public health in the future, when all of these young people will grow up. More than that, growing amount of sport facilities can be a remedy to avoid some other kind of addiction – computer addiction, which is commonly believed to be a serious problem among teenagers in our contemporary world of modern technologies.


On the other hand, it should be mentioned that physical activities can not ensure the sharp improving of public health, because there are people suffering from different deseases. And this problem could be solved by various social projects in order to help such people with money for their treatment, for instance. Undoubtly, this aspect of public health improving is on the shoulders of governments.


To conclude, I absolutely agree with the statement that sport facilities are essential for health of population as a whole. Yet, there are some other effective measures that may alter the outcome. Improving of health care is the challenge that governments must face.

It is common knowledge that the increased amount of flights has led to acute environmental problems such as air pollution and global warming. The governments are aleted with this and try to impose new taxes and change the policies in order to prevent total disaster. But the proposal of reducing the number of flights is questionable. This essay will examine both positive and negative sides of the issue. to begin with, the opinion that a lot of air travels in unnecessary has many arguments. Due to the developed internet and other technological achievements business can be run from any part of world. For instance, it is common way of doing projects nowadays – bringing the members of one project from the different countries in order to keep work running 24 hours a day. When some members go to sleep, others just begin their day. What is more, the laws of reducing the amount of air travel may encourage businessmen to develop economy of their own region. That can make a huge impact on national growth in the long period. As for travelers, the policy of restricting air flights may inspire people to travel across their native country and become more culturally awared. That are foreign countries, not the own ones that young people want to travel to and that should be changed. However, there are negative consequences of reducing air travel policy. Firstly, travelling broadens the mind and gives a different perspective to people. Not only cultural knowledge is known to be expanded after seeing the life in foreign countries, but also new efficient ways of running a business or even new economic spheres are discovered. Limiting air travelling may lead to decrease in economic activities and innovations due to the fact that air flights are the most popular and the fastest means of transport system. To conclude, air travel plays a great role in modern society both for business and leisure spheres. Although there is proof that the issue of global warming is caused by air travel, there are unfavourable consequences of limiting it. The negative changes can be both in economic and cultural part of people’s lives.

Others, however, assume that government should act to restrict these artists.


In my opinion, creative people should not have a complete freedom in expressing their views. First of all, if people will have the right to speak freely, other groups of people may suffer. For example, the racism may be created because of the complete freedom of people to say what they want. On the other hand, some diplomatic problems between countries can be caused by disrespectful and inappropriate films, pictures, music; in other words, it can result in important and even dangerous political issues.


Nevertheless, there are some people who think that a complete freedom should be given to creators so they can express their thoughts. They assume that in the free society people should have right to speak out loud their ideas. Moreover, some argue that there could not be any creativity if there are some rules for artists to follow. However, they failed to realize that lack of respect to other people resulted in any type of creation. Sometimes can cause a serious problem connected with nationalism.


All things considered, although many people think that creative people should express their thoughts in any way they want, I strongly believe that some restrictions should be made for people creating any artwork; people should respect each other and do not doubt each other's rights, even if they have different views on any issue. Any artistic creation should be a piece of pure art, not the proposal.

These kinds of things are certainly not happening without a cause. Economical crisises, wars, politcal conflicts. All of them make people turn into criminals, even the youngest ones. The crime rates amongst young adults is getting higher and higher each single day. But why does it happen?

Well, one good reason for that is certainly different types of conflicts or happenings, which affect people on a global scale. If we remeber the fall of the Soviet Union for instance, we can certainly recall a lot of stories about different gangs and notorius criminals, which ravaged the country. Back then It was hard to support yourself and crime was the only way out even for teenagers. Secondly, It can certainly be different psychological factors such as peer pressure. Youngsters can be certainly persuaded to take part in criminal activity If the offer is alluring.

All the information above sounds horrible, but what can we do about this? There's no precise answer out there,because every young man or woman has his or hers reasons for commiting crimes. The only good thing that parents and teachers can do, is to cultivate strong will in then and try to teach them critical thinking, so they would understand how doing ""bad"" things may affect the society and the country they are living in.

However, many viewers prefer British or American cinema to local pruducers. To change the situation, some suggest that government should financially support local film industries. But is it a reasonable thing to do?

To begin with, the most obvious reason for overwhelming popularity of American and British films is globalisation. By watching these films, the viewer is involved in global film-loving community, which speaks English at least as a second language, and have a global discussion about the films everybody on Earth is speaking about currently.
This is a thing which a non-English film production cannot overcome. However, it is possible to involve foreigners into our cinematography culture. To archieve it, it is a good thing to establish more cinematographic awards, where the films will be shown with English subtitles and where the overseas cinematographists will be invited to be among the judges.
By doing this, the local film production will have a fresh view on it, and the situations when the directors who know each other well will award each other nearly as friends will be impossible.
Moreover, it is essential to preserve and develop local cinematographic tradition.
In order to do this, it is neccessary to financially support cinema schools, where the new generation of the directors can be risen by the older one. Again, it is essential to invite foreign directors and students to exchange expirience.

On the other hand, in my opinion, financial support in the field of film-making itself sometimes (and often) does not have good results. It happens for the reason that the choice of films to be supported is often performed by people who are more interested in money and are not really connected with actual cinema. For example, a recent film about Russian YouTube bloggers was sponsored by Russian governmental structure, obviosly, due to the popularity of these people. Although huge money were involved into the project, it was not successful at all. Additionally, film inductry is not something that money of the citizens should be spent on. it is not fair when people pay money for something they clearly did not ask for and did not choose to watch. In addition, sometimes the government is trying to replace the dates of release of foreign films with the releases of local ones. For instance, that is what happening in Russia right now. In my view, on the contrary, it makes local film production more undesirible than it already is as this policy is definitely too aggresive.
All in all, I believe that it is important for government to support educational part of cinema world and to raise prestige of the local film production by establishing international awards. However, I strongly disagree with the point of view that local film production itself should be financially supported.",8

Eyes become dry and red, people see worse and have to wear glasses. I have such a problem, myself. Making a lot of home assignments on computer, I started to see worse and now I have to wear glasses.

Secondly, another big health problem could be caused by radiation produced by computers. It is scientifically proved that if you always put computer on your stomach, you may have problems with degestive and genital systems. The radiation is very harmful and you need to be very careful and make a rest during long work.

Thirdly, mordern technology allow to listen to a very good music. But everybody forget about the volume. If you listen to music very loudly, it may lead to deafness. Many young people don’t understand that, what makes them hear worse. It is very importaint to choose right headphose, that perfectly suit you and don’t harm your ear.

To sum up, I should say, that health problems caused by mordern technologies are very importaint. Every person should carefully look after his health and the health of his friends and relatives. Because radiation can cause cancer, pregnancy problems and other deseases.

This has become a major concern as many believe that youngsters are the basis of our society and, therefore, their moral corruption, which crime is largely associated is a problem that needs to be solved.
Before trying to look for solution, it is very important to distinguish the causes for such a change. I believe that there are to sides to the problem and both are somehow connected to emergence and development of new technologies. On the one hand, thanks to the Internet it has become even easier to be involved in illegal activities, like drug trade or information stealing. This contributes directly to the increase of crime rates - young people, who are good at dealing with all these new Information technologies, are given a new instruments for commiting crime - when they have started to use actively. On the other hand, due to new technologies work market has become more competitive, a lot of simple tasks are now done by computers, so those low-qualified youngsters find it harder to get a job now. This causes them to search for alternative ways of making money and, thus, turning to black market. Moreover, job search is accompanied by higher stress levels, so youngsters become more impulsive and aggresive - when makes them more likely to commit a crime like punching someone or even killing someone. 
Surely, if the causes are identified, some ways of improving the situation can be found. First of all, as life has become harder for young people, support and love get very important to help them maintain their emotional calmness. Therefore, parents should pay more attention to their kids and explain to them that, though, life is more stressful now, they still have someone to rely on. Then, of course, since childhood young people should be shown that crimes commited wit the use of the Internet are not anonymous as it may seem first and, therefore, lead to legal concequences and should be seen by children as crimes just as real and terrible as murder. Then, some changes to the job market should be introduced - the free courses for those young people who want to find work. But this is the task of the government, rather than of parents and teachers.
To sum up, I would like to say that the problem of the increasing numbers of youngsters being involved in crimes is very important and should be dealed with actively. Parents and teachers with love, support and education can make a tremendous step on the way to the solution of the problem and if participated by the government - can be really effective in decreasing crime rates among youngsters.

There can be many points of view at that problem and different countries choose different methods to reduce crime.
One way of solving the problem is violence as the answer to violence. There can be prison sentences that longs decades or laws that give opportunity to kill some of the criminals. People who prefere that way believe that it can scare potetial criminals so they would be forced to find other way to live than breaking the law. Moreover, this way prooved its successfullness by decades and centuries of using force to make criminals away from other people.
The second way of reducing the level of crimes is created to solve the main reason of most of all crimes - the lack of money. There is not a secret that many people live hard and cruel life but some of them have not even opportunity to change it. The people that do not accept long prison sentences believe that laws that protect groups of people who can not protect themselves, helping to thouse who needs help and the chance to live better life, could increase the global level of education and level of life. More than that, these people propose to help the criminals to solve they problems and make them feel really sorry for the things that they have done to their victims and pay for it. It would also reduce level of crime just because there would not be thouse who does not see other way to solve their problems.
In my opinion both methods have their problems such as riscs of mistakes of the first way and difficulty of the second.To tell the truth, the first way seems enough right because it provides the opportunity of revenge for the victims of criminals, while the second way may seem too soft and not effective. To make a conclusion, I think that second way is more effective during the long time and it should reconstruct all the society to achieve its goal, but it is the thing that should have been done to defend everyone and to rise the society at the next level of evolution of relationships between humans.",7

It is a big problem of current life. Humans are devided into two groups: some people think that we should make the prison sentence longer, others think that there are a various ways to solve this problem.
First of all, I should try to explain why the first group have such opinion. People believe that a long sentence in prison can be a good example for others. That other people think many times before doing a crime. Nevertheless, they don't think about people who can get into the prison by mistake. Such humans have to stay in prison for all their lifes or for a quite long sentence.
I join for the second group of opinions. I believe that there are a lot of alternative ways to reduce a crime. At first, we should realise the real causes of a crime. We should learn, behave prisoners that prevent crimes. Moreover, in my opinion, making a prison sentences longer do not solve this problem. Many people know how it is bad to be in a prison, but they still do some crime.
We should try to do people's life better to reduce the crime. It may be better to make attention on behaviour of people from the early age, from a school ot even kindergarden.
People should make the attention on the causes of the crime and try to solve the problems which push people to do some crime.
Why people, for instance, stole some products or other things? May be they have some problems with money or they have some phsihological problems, so it is better to solve such king of problems. Of course, it is may be difficult to do, but we should try. I believe that giving longer prison sentences has not got a good results.

However, some people believe that such an activity does not worth our time. This essay disagrees with this statement because the sphere of sport plays a great role in our life today. In this essay I will provide some reasons in order to support my opinion, followed by the relevant examples.
As for the first point, watching live sports occasions or TV matches can make people closer to each other. When people have more free time on their hands, they gather together, support their team and communicate. A good exapmle here can be the The World Hockey Championship which is hold every year in spring. Spectators become like one team which watch all the matches, reveal some mistakes of players and spend good time. For instance, the play between Russia and Finnland is always complicated beacuse these teams are usually neck and neck. In other words, it is a level playig field, and people can realize what the real patriotic feeling is.
As for another point, the process of watching such sports events may help people, especially women, to know more about different types of sport. What I mean is that we can learn the special vocabulary, which is considered to be specific for each kind of sport. Moreover, in our daily life we use a great number of idioms and phrases in our speech which have come from sport. For example, the idiom ""to jump the gun"" from racing which means ""to hurry"" or ""to do something before a start"".
In conclusion, I would like to say the theme of sport is vital today and plays a signifant role. That is why watching sports events is essential and people who belive that it is a waste of time should rethink this issue.",7

Nowadays each man can commit quick movements wherever he wants thanks for cars, trains and especially plans. Nevertheless, air transport demands a lot of resourses from the Earth, dramatically interfering its environment. Whether the main world governments ought to take certain measures to decrease the amount of flights related to business and leisure is a controversial issue worth discussing.
There is a group of people, which can be named environmentfriendly, that believes that the main reason causes air pollution is air transport because of its harm influence on the atmosphere. To begin with, the common researches give a graph illustrating the way of global warming. According these researches, all types of transport contribute to the ecological disaster; the main culprit is a plane. Moreover, every flight produce such a big amount of carbon dioxide that can be only produced by hundred of automobiles. The building of planes doesn't solve the most important problem of the Earth which threatens our existense. So why we continue to construct more ones? In addition, flights committed are generaly not very essential, because our ecologu does not have to suffer from someone's business desires.
Other people claim that it is undoubtedly exellent to understand that each point of the map can be achieved in a few time by simle using of a plan. Hence the special laws putting limit on this type of transport are not necessary at all. Firstly, sometimes we need to move from one country to another in a very mobile way, because of several reasons. A plan represent a good tool for such task. Secondly, air transport can even simplify the exchange of knowledge. In its turn, it may helps people to make new science and art achievments.
Overall, despite all benefits of flights the level of air pollution and global warming don't cease to increase. Personally, i think that we are able to alter this system and upgrade it. Hopefully, in the future people will put more attention to the environment issue and will try to forget about their private interest in favour the Earth.",7

In my opinion, the modern way of life makes children more cruel and lonely which lead to boost in crimes among teenagers.
To begin with, there are many reasons why young people decide to commit a crime. Firstly, the content that we see on TV or Youtube is mostly violent. Computer and telephone games are full of murders, blood and cruelty. It is not a surprise that after seeing crimes everywhere a person decriminalizes it in his or her head and starts to think that it is normal. Secondly, adults are tent to work more nowadays, which is why parents does not communicate with their children much. It can lead to kids' depression and a feeling of loneliness. To draw the parents' attention, kids become thieves because it seems to be The only way to become visibe for parents. The last but not the least, it is extremely difficult for a young person to find a job in modern society because of lack of working experience. It can lead to stealing. Not being able to earn enough money legally, young people start being involved in illegal actions.
The most significant issue here is to find a way of tackling this problem. To my mind, parents should spend more time with children, explain them that there is always a way of solving a problem without cruelty. Parents should give their kids enough love, care and support, which will lead to better emotional health of children. As for teachers, they should talk more about values, be role models for children and explain that kids can become successful while being honest and kind.
To sum, there is a problem of a widespread criminal involvement among young people, but parents and teachers could help solving it.

Let is begin with the reasons for this. On the one hand, British and American film industries are more popular because of the financial support, which the government gives them. As we can see if film has the best actors and good equipment, it means that film has a good financial support. For example, if film industries want to see popular actors playing in their films, actors should have a good salary for this job. Moreover, if they want to have a good camera or place, where the film will be, they also should have a money to rent it.
On the other hand, many people all over the world like superheroes or stories, which are more closely for their interests or unreal lifes. People want to watch movies, where they can take place, where they can be every character they want. It is obviously, that if we want to forget about our problems, we can go to the cinema and watch the movie about Spider-man or X-men. Watching these films we can go away from the real life. So, film industries, which have a good financial support have a chance to help us to solve our problems, whereas local film industries cannot. They can only tell us stories, which are closely to our real lifes.

Also knowledge not depends on who you are woman or man, it depends on how you study, prepare an exam and so on. In addition, I would like to say that everyone have different thoughts on their future career, specialization. Some are not so famous and wide spread than others.

So, there are 2 views on the existence of such phenomena.
From the one hand, everyone should respect such talented people as musicians and producers who provide us with really useful things for our relaxing or scientific satisfying. Thus, they must have a right to be paid for their work and users of the Internet who download pirate files should be punished for illegal enjoyment. Furthermore, the copying and sharing music or films in of non-original form lead to deteriorating of the products’ quality. The reason of it can be films recorded on videocameras from cinemaparks or music, recorded on the concerts. In such way it seems that people of art producing really waste their money to create a good proffesional picture or sound.
On the other hand, in the era of developing technologies it is really convenient to use social networks or specialized applies as a platform to store music compositions or films. Thus, many people are ready to commit a law and have a free wealth. However, this problem is decided by Apple corporation which has a huge music resource free for three months. Moreover, there is a problem of people’s equality. It is considered that everyone should have a right to use a wealth which is made and prepared to public. So, it should be available not only for those people who have a financial opportunity to pay for listening for a music or watching films.
To sum up, it is really important for musicians and film producers to share their “masterpieces” with all people in equal form.

In the age of 25-34 the time spent on physical training decreased twofold and made up 153,8 minutes for men and 92,8 minutes for woman in comparison to youngsters. Although the there was a big difference in time spent on sport between the people aged 16-24 and 25-34, the figures tend to decline not so shraply for the people of more age. While the number of minutes for men and women of 35-44 years was 120,6 and 92,6 respectively, this number for people of 45-54 years was 114,2 for men and 70,2 for women.

However, it is usually not mentioned that, at the same time, this rate is rising for some of the groups as, for instance, teenagers and young people. In this essay I will elaborate on major causes of this problem and on some possible solutions to it.

The first factor that could lead to the increase of crimes commited by the young is a rather significant number of children who become orphans. It is a well-known fact that the example of family is vital for the right upbringing. When kids don't have this example as well as love and affection that they need so much while growing they are more exposed to the danger of becoming a part of the world of crime. In this case the burden of solving of this problem lays on teachers. If a kid is raised without parents teachers should play the role of an advisor and tutor on whom children can relay and who will be a great example of a decent person.

The second reason for the rise of the juvenile crime is the exposure of the young to the violence which they observe on a daily basis while watching TV or playing computer games. Nowadays with the technological advancement entertainment industry is developping dramatically and one of its most promising spheres is computer and 3d technology. Unfortunately, they tend to be more and more focused on violent games and films which involve burgling, kidnapping and even killing people. Children who are very sensible to the examples they see around them can adopt this behaviour and consider it as a normal one. The solution to this problem can be the restriction of acces to Tv and computers and the control of the content on them by parents. Besides, there are some special programs that can be intsalled in order to help parents to control their children's usage of computers and TV.

To conclude, although the problem of the increasing juvenile crime is extremely crucial, there are some steps and tactics that can be effective as, for instance, the support of orphans by their teachers or the control of the acces to television and computers.",7

This problem should be taken under discussion othertwise the number of crimes would be increasing.
To begin with, well growing up plays the significant role in behaviour of adolescents. Parents should take care of ther children and explain how vital is not to commit a crime and think about their future. As a matter of fact, a great amount of teenagers thinks that it is the most simple way to make their living and starts grabbing things from the shops. In other words, it is important to get trough the gap year by talking to you children since young age. On the other hand, it is dificcult to reach a compromise with teenagers because at this age they prefer to trust their friends and the only way to solve the problem is to control the friends of your children.

Moreover, education is a key factor to avoid crimes made by young people. To give an example, the goverment should create the course about discipline and encourage people to gain knowledge about laws and how do they work to decline the percentage of crimes. By and large, it is rather long way to get rid of crimes but it, apperently, would work. For instance, there are lessons about discrimination and sexual harassment in schools, it is possible to add talks about crimes or gives examples of people who behaved that way and ended badly.

To make a conclusion, the rising amount of crimes commited by young people is the problem which is needed to be solved so by joining efforts we can decrease the rate of crimes.",7

To begin with, it is clear that artists should have more freedom in realizing themselves. Some rules can be harmful not only for their personality, but for their career at all. Secondly, some ways of expression the feelings are really helpful for creative person, but they can seem to be rude and unpleasant for other people. This misunderstanding can be bad for both sides of the conflict. And if the artist is careful about feelings of other people and does not act as he want in sight this way of expression becomes useless, because artist without viewers is nothing. 
On the other hand there are some situations when creative people go mad and do a lot of harm with their actions. Sometimes they can think that they bring art through pain. One more fact is about street artists. Their art is to draw on the buildings. 
For some people it seems really beautiful, but for some it is a unrespect of the history and architecture. 
On this basis, I can conclude that every person, artistic or not, should know rules, which are followed by the community, where he lives.

On the one hand, male and female students should have fair opportunities of getting knowledge they need. Every subject should be available for any hardworking student. It is true that both genders have their strong sides at particular fields of education and there mustn’t be any barriers for entering the interesting sphere for a man or a woman.
On the other hand, some people suppose that there are some subjects where men are more likely to be successfull than women. For instance, the history gives us a lot of examples of man being talented in math subjects such as physics. Historically, woman were always better at house-keeping or cooking. They claim that woman in science is quite a modern trend. Personally, I don’t agree with this point of view.
To sum up, I would say that everyone should have equal chances of getting education. No matter what happened in the past there should be a fair opportunity for one who wants to study to be able to choose the branch they want to learn about. I agree that men and women have different talents and skills but there also should be a space for someone who has non-standard fields of interest.

In addition, feminists opened this opportunity for women and many woman have job nowadays. That is why both parents work and do not sit with their children. It can be dangerous for kids, first of all, because kids spend time with internet, their environment, for example with othe kids on dangerous occasions. Secondly, the child can have psychological problems without parents’ communication, he can close the door to other people in his soul. However, many people see advantages of this.

On the one hand, some people tend to think that banning for a short or limited period (for example, 2 years) allows such athletes to realise their mistakes, thus giving them an opportunity to achieve their goals in the nearest future. Moreover, banning for the rest of their lives might have a negative impact on their career and reputation.
On the other hand, such method is not the panacea to the problem as nobody guarantees that a sportsman would not use illegal drugs again. Besides, it wouldn't help to take control of those who is trying to neglect the law or has already made attempts to do it.
In my view, athletes caught using drugs should be strictly punished and banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives because in this case such a fair punishment which meets the requirement of moral circumstances, will not let other sportsmen follow in their footsteps.

Almost 60 percent of people adore Instagram and only 6 percent of pensioners love using Instagram as well.
25 percent of people in their middle age used Instagram. Going further and speaking about the third social network we can say that the least usage of LinkedIn was among people who are 18 and who 65 years old. These figures stayed at the same level of 22 percent per each of them.There is a slight difference in using LinkedIN among people who are under 49 and those who are 50-64 years old.

Secondly, all of typical crimes lead to human death or hurt. Even if we will classify downloading pirate copies of some content as a crime, it should not have hard punishment.

On the one hand, the pirate copies doesn’t let musicians and produsers earning more money, they could lose million of dollars because of pirate copies. Also, because of this reasone they could lose motivation to create anything else. Do you remember what Beoynce said once? ‘If you are adore what I do, if you respect me as a person, if you are my truly fan, you will buy only official products by me’.

On the other hand, let’s look on people who, for example can’t efford a ticket to the cinema? Or they just can’t buy an official Beoynce album in Itunes. So what do they have to do? Are anyone able to make them to stop loving Martin Scorsese movies or Beoynce songs? No. These poor people go to the pirates sites because of love to their favorites actors/singers. Not because of bad minds or something like that. 

In conclusion I want to say, that downloading a pirate copies from internet isn’t a crime, it makes singers/actors more famous anyway. And maybe, if the pirate copies problem will be solved one day, all this famous people could lose a lot of their truly fans.

There are both advantages and disadvantages in such kind of approach. There are several advantages of such way of developing a business. First of all, it is the cheap working force. The labour of local people can be paid less because in much cases the level of unemployment is very high in poor countries, so those people do not have a choise what kind of work to do. Another thing is that the costs for renting a place in poorer countries is much lower than in developed, so it is profitable for international companies to move their business in such zones. Such a situation now is in South-East Asia where much of departments if international countries are located. Surely, all these advantages make the product's cost lower than in would be in more developed countries. Of course, there are some disadvantages. One of them is that the companies often do not think about the enviromental problems of poorer countries. The factories belonging to international companies pollute the area because the governments of these countries do not control the level of polluting the enviroment. So, the Earth really suffers from it. Another disadvantage is that the company often cannot control the businesses in poorer countries because of the long distances between the main office and the departments. To conclude, there are both advantages and disadvantages in the strategy of moving their business to poorer countries. Although for companies those advantages are really important, they should not forget about the interests of local people. And, of course, the governments should control whether such companies observe the law of this country. ",7

It is said that airplanes pollute air and this is certainly an awful thing. So from one point of view, it is necessary to reduce the number of flights made on a daily matter. First of all, our duty is to safe planet from our own existence and it seems reasonable to cut the amount of air travel. Government should push laws concerning the air traffic, but they also must consider the consequensies. This means that regarding the fact that people are not prepared to sacrafice their right to travel. They will search for alternative ways to travel. So, no wonder, if the amount of cars, buses and other means of transport would take their lead.
To my mind, it is irrational for governments to enforce air companies to decrease the number of flights considerably. That may lead to other problems which are harder to solve. Moreover, closing air space over some countries as a way of reduction air traffic may be considered as a threat by other countries which would cause more tension than ever before.
In other words, the idea of considerable intervention in the air travel by government is a complete failure. Companies must decide themselves if they are ready to sacrafise their incomes for the sake of planet or not.

To begin with, the problem which makes teenagers comming crimes is the lack of money, for example thay can see that their clssmates are more invested than they are and they will try to be suitable for these particular group. In this case their parents should find suitable schools for them, where then wiil not feel miserable and consequently there will be no need to commite crimes.

The second reason why teens can act auwful is the bad surroundings, like friends or community where they are trying to express their personality. This sittuation is pretty common among the teen, who are trying to identify their personality. To avoid this cause teachers and parents should make some special talks about what consequences can follow you after you would be catched, showing them that the panishment is closer than they think.

Finally,acting against the law can be cause by simply game which is popular nowadays. Young people, for example, shoplift and then they count the price of the products and generate the winner. Solving this particular sittuation parents should try to save their children from this groups of teen, spending the laisure time of their childrent to the helpful activities like sport and other hobbies. Teen will have no free time to spend it on such stupid things. On top of that, parents should tell or show to what can prevent such activities.

Some people say that if perpetrators are forsed to spend more time in prison, the crime rates will decrease, while others tend to disagree and believe that prisons do not help in reducing crime at all. Long prison sentences may not  be effective in changing the criminals way of thinking, but t least they keep the traitors away from normal people for a long time. Such practice is already applied in some countries such as the United States, where one easily spend the rest of his or her life in jail, even if this one performed just one murder or robbery. You could see such ridiculously strict penalties consequences in movies like “The Shawshank Redemption” where an inmate who was found quilty while being a youngster was set free only when he became an old man. He couldn’t integrate to the new society after release and as a result committed suicide. The bad news is that after such a long time spend in a jail one not usually start a new life from a scratch. The system leaves criminals little else to do but committing crimes again. On the other hand, methods other than jail proved better efficiency in changing perpetrators’ behavior, especially the ones who committed a crime accidentially. These methods are applied in many European countries such as Norway, where jail cells look like expensive hotel rooms, and the staff is generous and doesn’t use violence as a form of control. I also read that some non-profit organizations move some prisoners who behaved well from a usual jail to an apartment just before release. These organizations also try to find a job these ex-criminals, enhancing their integration to socium. And this form of reducing crime looks the most appealing to me. Unfortunately, these organizations do not work in Russia. Here, without a doubt, it will take a long time to reform the ways of punishment. Our officials still think that good jail is still the perfect way to fight crime. And I don’t like this tendency much.

Facebook is the most popular social network: its percentage use is higher than of two other services for each age groups. More than half of Americans use it, and its popularity is higher in younger groups - the percentage use decreases monotonically from ""18-29"" group to ""65+"" one.
The distribution of Instagram's popularity is correlated with Facebook: we see the same trend of its descension with respect to age. However, its absolute parameter of popularity is lower than Facebook's one - it is approximately 1.5 times less for young people and more than 2 times for three elder groups.
What differs LinkedIn distribution from previous ones is that its popularity among people aged 30-49 and 50-64 is higher than among young people (18-29). It can be certainly asserted than LinkedIn is less popular than Facebook; however, it cannot be compared with Instagram's popularity in terms of absolute values, but the fact is that more people aged 30+ use LinkedIn than Instagram.
The main point is that Facebook is the most popular social network, but Instagram and LinkedIn are used by different age groups with different percentage.

This trend highlighted by newspapers and TV shows attracts public attention and raises a question of possible causes and solutions of the prominent problem.
In a modern world, young people can obtain an easy access to the information published in the Internet, which includes a wild range of cruel TV-series and games. It is a well-known fact that watching TV and playing video games leads to increased violence among people.
Being active users, young people transfer the actions and behavior from imaginary worlds to the real one. Moreover, the pace of living of today’s adults implies that they have less time left for bringing up their children if they choose to pursue their careers. As a results, kids are not aware of proper public and social rules. What is even more important, the lack of parents’ attention pushes them to cruel and violent behavior on the streets. The growing concerns about the issue lead to an active discussion and enforce the society to solve the problem.
Children spend a great part of their time with parents. The latter could explain social rules in more details and save kids from negative impact of others.
Young adults’ behavior is the result of the upbringing and parents affect it directly. If they explain better what is allowed and what is prohibited, the number of teenagers’ crimes will plummet. Moreover, if parents keep their kids busy with hobbies and interact with them more actively, children will have less time on cruel video games. The second part of kids’ time is spent in school. Teachers could influence students, being more patient and paying more attention to their lives. The school community could organise a series of meetings on psychological support. If children feel that they are not deprived of help in times when they are in trouble, they will not commit crimes.
The increased level of young adults’ crimes is a warning signal in a modern world. Teenagers and children spend more time playing cruel video games and watching poor quality TV shows that lead to violence and crimes.
Parents and teachers have to pay closer attention to the problems of the growing generation and help them to overcome their troubles, otherwise the rate of crimes commited by young people will only climb.

Statistics tell that the number of youngsters who committe crimes are increasing year by year. In my opinion, there are some general causes of this trend and possible sollutions. In my essay I will describe them.

Very often this issue has its roots in deprived childhood and not sheltered upbringing. Sometimes, children are living in bad conditions and do not have enough food and clothes. In such situations, they can try to bring some things from shops and from their friends because they just do not understand why someone has it and they do not. To tackle this problem parents and teachers shold always teach children to be honest, hardworking, kind to reach their goals by hard work and passion, not by crimes. Many young people with deprived childhood and wise upbringing reach success in the future.

However, the problem may stem from a broken home or parents who do not care, too. When parents have conflicts they may divorse, and a child stay with one of the parents. In such situation, a child do not see both parents often because the one who he or she is living with has to work a lot. So, very often parents do not care about the upbringing and teaching of the child. And a young man or girl may meet bad company and no one can tell him or her that it is not right because parents do not care or do not have time for their son or daughter. So this company starts to committe crimes and so does the child and then he is going to prison. And the life is ruined. To tackle this problem, parents should care and not forget about their children education. They should know who are the friends of the child, what they are doing together. And if taechers notice something unusual, thay have to inform parents.

To sum up, nowadays, there are many young criminals, far more than it used to be. There are quite a lot of situations that can lead to crimes commited by children. However, there are many ways to stop this. And the ones who can help children are mostly their own parents and teachers.",8

But not so many people think about how much money musicians and film producers lose because of illegal sowrces of their product.

On the one hand, some people think that people who don’t want to pay money for music and films and try to find them for free should be punished. Their position is clear, because of course people who create all these things got nothing for lots of time, money and talent they needed to create that or another song or film, which is not really honest. Also illegal copies bring lots of money to their owners, who in fact do nothing but copying the material created by others, so film producers and musicians have to deal with money problems connected with their art; whereas other people who don’t work as much as they are and just cell their works become very rich.

But on the other hand, illegal copies of music and films can be a good advertisement of people who created them. For example, you won’t pay much money to go to a concert of a musician, whose art you don’t know really well, but if it’s your favorite singer, whose songs you’ve accidently found in the Internet, of course you’ll buy a ticket even if it costs  a lot. Also pirate copies can help people became noticed. Lots of famous musicians were found with the help of illegal audios of their works, which somebody published in his website. So sometimes people share their art for free themselves to become popular and reach success. 

To talk about myself, I agree with the second position, because it’s very difficult to become popular and, what is more important, stay popular only with the help of legal sources of your art. Today, in the 21st century, people are addicted to the Internet, they find everything there and can’t live without it. So it’s wrong to stop it.

The aim of performers is to attract the audience attention and sometimes they break all rules and do amoral things, which can shock other people. The main solution of such problem is government restrictions. Only when people are afraid of doing crazy things they will not do it.
	On the other hand there is another opinion. Some people think that people should be allowed to express themselves because all people have freedom and can do everything to say something to the world, but it depends on the way they show their thoughts and feelings. There are different beautiful things people can do to make this world brighter. For example street art or street music, it is always followed by positive reaction, makes people’s mood better. If noone express themselves we will never know about creative and talanted artists, singers, musicians, writers, actors. The world then will be boring and grey.
	From my opinion people should express their emotions but they must notice the borders and know the main rules, especially moral rules. Because sometimes people do strange creepy things which shocked publicity.
	Generally speaking, government should make some rules for people who want to be noticed by doing creative things, only then there will not be different awfull accidents.

Do we have to support our local film industries and deny foreign film production? In my opinion, we do not have to do all this.
It is not a secret that western companies spend more money on film producing to invite Hollywood stars such as Bred Pitt and so on. The quality of their actor skills almost always is much higher than those ones of local actors and actresses. This point is the most important one for any film which was made to fascinate people all over the world, so we should not even compare the quality of such films. Furthermore, a great film industry pays a huge attention to cameras and other technical devices which are used during film production, whereas local companies cannot afford it. Governments and societies do not give any financial support to local industries, so we can not reach this gap now, but we should try. So, the most important argument for watching western films is a high quality of films, which is no more than the result of a great funancial support.
Another point that is worth noticing is the process of globalisation at the 21th century. As everybody knows, western companies always demonstrate products of a high quality, user-friendly, which are easy to understand for groups of people. So, the globalisation encourages us to use all achievements of humanity, and films are not an exception in this case. People want to watch and use things of a great quality, they try some strange products just as a challenge and never want to return to this again. This phrase is suitable to describe a situation in film industry as a whole. Having opportunities to watch high approciated films even for free, people will not just try to watch something worse from local companies. Furthermore, local companies try to be similar to western companies and add similar plots to films, this strategy does not work in this way. They had better use some local historical and cultural plots for films and work for local auditory without ambitions to reach stars without special technical devices and professional actors. If they begin from some local stories and something which is much closer to a real life of a local man, it will be much easier but more interesting for local people. In my point of view, we should use something which was never showed by somebody else and this way can help us become leaders in this small part of a huge cinema industry without comparing to western films with history which is so different from our one.
To sum up, I want to say that a financial support is necessary for the development of local film industries, but they should change the direction of the development of shooting. In this case, people can prefer local films rather than British or American ones.",8

Birth rate during this period was also getting down until it reached the lowest point in 1950. Furthermore, from 1950 we see that the number of population jumped up while death rate remained the same from 1950 to 2000 and birth rate began to grow from 1950.
To conclude, we can say that from 1750 to 2000 the population of the USA has been growing up. During these years, there was a tendency in both birth and death rates to fall down. However, birth rate increased in the end of the period.",7

The sanctions should be levied on the person copying material which is the ownership of a company or other individuals and such cases should be brought to court.
One of the reasons for that is that pirate copying eliminates the profit of producers of such goods. The idea is the following: every product including music records and films considers in its price the cost of factors used in its production – labour, capital, enterpreneurship skills and so on – and some extra amount of money to bring profit to producers. For example, the production of bread consists of the cost  of ingredients, cost of baker labour and etc. When people go to the store to buy bread, they pay for free (excluding some “free bread for pensioners”). If they do, they commit a crime and should go to jail. The films and music are no difference, just the price of them is distributed among several people or things (like tickets in the movie theatre or CD-disks). So if a person does not pay for the usage of those he/she should be punished the same way, as a bread-thief.
Moreover, illegal sharing of films and movies discriminates the ownership rights of producers. The goods they make are not public and can be easily excluded from consumption therefore every usageof those goods should bring profit. It is easier if consider it as a patent. Until patent cost is less then profit, the innovations will be made (so new movies will be filmed). If patients fail (firm does not gain profit from extra production) the profit of the firm becomes negative, which means no innovations. Nobody wants not to be paid for their work. This situation can be overcome only by government intervention by subsidising the production of special goods or sponsoring their own production. Thus, government failures occur too often, so in the end ordinary users will not be able to consume the same amount and variety of goods (including films and music records). Therefore, there should be established a working judicial system to protect the ownership rights with decent punishment for not obeying the rules in order to provide people with their favourite music and movies.
To sum up, special laws should be established to protects the rights of producers and provide various products for people’s use.

Young boys and girls are being frequently acquired of committing robberies, attacks or even murders nowadays. Such horryfying trend force people, especially parents, to search for reason of this phenomenon and figure out methods of dealing with it.
In my opinion, causes of this problem can vary. Firstly, parents are using easier manners of home education, Moms and dads tend to grow up their children in a free atmosphere to let them think broader and develop themselves In the society. Sometimes it can lead yougsters to take after their weakly educated peers a even criminals which ends up in their own crime involvement. Secondly, the cause of youth crimikability may become the growing poverty among families in many countries. Lack of money is able to make people become criminals to earn their living.
Nevertheless, there are many ways to cope with this problem. Spending more time with one's child and trying to understand his youth problems may be one of the solutions. Parents spend much time working nowadays and it can lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding, between parents and kids. So, it should be fixed not to let children break lawl. What is more, comprehensive psychological support especially in schools can reduce the number of crimes by solving mental problems of growing persons. Of course, youngsters with their own problems may not be able to deal with them by themselves and protest through breaking the law.
To conclude, it is necessary to mention that the problem is extremely actual and up-to date. Leaving alone the dependance of this problem from the behaviour and attitude of parents and family, it is necassary to struggle the mental reasons of such social deviations.

First of all, it is widely supposed that modern teenagers have lost the sense of responsibility for their actions. Some of them are overprotected by their parents and that may cause their obcene behavior. Parents should spend more time and effort to explain them the basics of norms that are accepted in the society.

What is more, children that are brought up in a family of alcoholics or drug-addicted parents usually copy their lifestyle. They are nurtured in the atmospere of hatred and cruelty and consider it normal. These young victims can be saved with the help of social service, psychologists and teachers who can truly take care of them and save them from possible future of criminals.

In addition, some movies and video games may affect a child`s flexible mind.
Those that contain murders, rapes, harassment which escape the punishment, may seem realistic to a young player or viewer and trigger him to do the same. Parents can control the content that attracks their children and also convince them that the events shown in films and games are fiction and turning them into life may cause terrible consequences.

To sum up, the rising number of crimes commited by teenajers is a serious social problem. However, following the recommendations given, their intentions to break the law can be prevented at early stages.",7

So, males and females have equal rights nowadays in all spheares of life. This rule also concerns educational process their all people have a right to have an education, besides, they are free to choose any subject they want. Moreover, is it appropriate for universities to accept  males and females in every subject equaly?
First of all, if we speak of equality of men and women we should make a notice that this also mean that women could not do some work which is not suit them (take heavy things). In other ways it is known that females can choose freely their profession. Secondly, we can easily think of jobs which will be more priority for males such as military professions.
What is the goal of setting the rule when universities accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject? Will it really provide equality? It is set by the laws that everyone has an opportunity to study the subject he prefers. This rule is enough for the realisation of the principle mentioned above.
Another factor which may be set against that rule is a different propostion of population of males and females in the country. It would be hard to reach equal numbers because women simply can be more than men or overwise, so this argument makes that rule almost impossible.
Of course universities may try to bistribute makes and females during educational process in different groups equaly and that probably will bring positive result. 
To sum up, everyone both males and females has a right and opportunity to choose their profession and study in a place they want. It will not be appropriate for university workers trying to choose students by the criteria of equality of males and females instead of professional qualities and knowledge, which may have every person.

However, there are those who claim that this not the best option and there are better ways of reducing the crime. I personally support those who think that giving longer prison sentences would only make the situation worse. Firstly, the prisoners form a very specific kind of society which has a great impact on everyone who is a part of it. The more time one spends in this society, the more used to it they are going to get, and their mind would turn into a mind of a real criminal even though their first crime was not that terrible. Secondly, the chances to adopt to normal life after the prison sentence are already low as prisoners lose their skills and knowledge, and thereputation of even former criminals makes employers to avoid giving them a job, and a great number of years spent in prison makes it even more hard. However, those who support the idea of longer prison sentences claim that this the best choice as the criminals are isolated for a longer period of time, which means that common citizen are more protected from them. I see the point, but to my mind the disadvantages are too big to ignore them. Firstly, prisons are built and run with these common citizens' taxes, so if the prisons are full, then people have to pay more money for them, and this amount can become extremely big. Secondly, many of isolated criminals will get free eventually and, according to the second paragraph of this work, they will get back to their criminal business again as there is no way for them to start a new life after so many years in jail. In conclusion I would like to state that giving longer prison sentences are a too simple approach to the crime problem. The real solutions should be far more complicated and mild as the best way to reduce the crime is not to let people do anything for which they can be sentenced, and this means that it is more about improving people's education, moral principles and values instead of laws.",7

Furthermore, it is not a secret that our young generation is a truly lazy one, so up-to-date children would rather watch sport games on Tv than being engaged themselves.
On the other hand, i can not but agree that for those who contemplate a career in sport live sports events can help to acquire new knowledge and improve some weak points.
Besides, it should be mentioned that a lot of families get united when sitting together in front of a Tv and having heated debates on a particular sports topic. In addtion, i want to admit that national sports ocassions translated by means of Tv have an objective to trigger some patriotic feelings.

I fully disagree with this view and strongly believe that such suggestion is absolutely unefficient.
First of all, it is obvious that men are more inclined to specific professions, and receive better results working in some fields. For instance, in engineering or physics specializations more men succeded, probably because of a different way of thinking. If universities start to accept the same number of male and female students, the progress in science is very likely to decrease. Subsequently, it will lead to the loss of efficiency and less developments. Moreover, if there are some vacant places on a certain faculty and all women are already accepted, the rest of the men applied for this programme will not have a chance to get education.
In contrast, some people contend that this suggestion should be accepted in order to obtain national equality and eliminate the descrepancy between both genders. Notwithstanding this idea, I think that this solution to the problem of unequality is not right. Students should be choisen by their skills and abilities that they demonstrated on the exams, otherwise it seems likely that talented or smart people in one field risk to study the subject they are not keen on.
Overall, to my mind, suggested idea mainly aimed to solve the problem of inequality, will only exacerbate the situation,, leading to a more serious descrepancy between men and women.

Art has always been an important part of our life. It means that we need all the artists and other creative people who feed our minds and souls, who help us to develop, who give us a fuel for thoughts. So it artists won't have a freedom to express their ideas, we (ordinary people) won't have all the benefits of art. If their would be governmental control under art, we would get in our minds what government wants. It means that we won't be free. Such a situation was in the USSR, for example.


More than that, artists are also human beings. And it's normal, that they cannon bring out their potential in 100% way, if they work under tension, or in the censorship. With no doubts, we can say, that interventions in art by government will affect creativity in a negative way.


Also, many artists and other creative people sometimes criticize things, which happen around them, political regime for example. To my mind it's a goes wrong in a country. It helps evaluate problems of different periods.

The reasons of increased attention to this topic is the jump of the frequency of law breaks among youngers. What is the cause of such unusual growing of criminal activity? And what steps should society take to prevent futher increasing of crime commiting children and teens? As for my opinion, the main reason to law disobediance is lack of support from other parts of society. That is why parents and teachers should be ones to fix this situation by giving more attention to youngers they look after.
The social pressure, stress, depression, troubles with friends, first love and lack of time are the main problems youngest generation faces very frequently and knows too good. Teens hormonal changes and mental distability prevents them from solving these problems successfully all alone. That is why they tend to solve situations in a very radical and dramatical way, which often leads to commiting a crime. On the other hand, almost all young people have or should have special grown ups to look after them and help to become a good part of society. Lack of this help leads to the stated problem of growing criminality among youngs.
Thus, parents and teachers as people closest to young generation should take the situation under control. The most obvious idea to do it is to give more attention to children to children and teenagers. Indeed, it is known, that it is common situation, that parents are too busy earning money to get into all details of their child life As for teachers, they often have too much people in class to give proper attention to each individual. But from the other side it is possible for both parents and teachers to cooperate and notice worrying tendentions together. For example, teacher is able to feel changes in whole behavior pattern of his students and give know parents in case something wrong, and then they would take a closer look on changes in their child behaviour.
All in all, it is clear that rising crime committment rate among youngsters is a fact society cannot close eyes on. That is why both parents and teachers should give much attention to younger generation in order to prevent this situation to continue by giving younger people support they need.

There are several possible causes of this development, but the main reason is obviously the spread of computer games. Nowadays a teenager do not face problems with access to computer shooters and digital mazes full of bloody monsters. These games teach youngsters how to kill. Faced with murders and violence in computer games, teenager considers anger as a normal way of acting. The difference between the reality and imagined world is gone for young people. That is why story, when a child with axe murders family for prohibiting playing computer, exists.
Another reason of such trend can be the lack of opportunity for young people. Youngsters, struggling with self-realisation, and suffer from lack of motivation, see no solution of their situation, except committing a crime. On the labour market young experts are not demanded. It is hard for them to find job.
However, paying more attention to child’s activity can easily solve the problem. If parents and teachers pay attention to teenager’s development, interests and education, the trend will probably decrease. What is more, computer games are the sign of boredom, that is why it is important to provide youngster with extra courses. Person who finished high education, has less chance to commit a crime. Statistic, provided by developed countries, shows that crucial amount of crimes involve people without education.
To sum up, if parents want to prevent their child from crimes and prizon, they need to pay attention to his or her education and provide different opportunities as free-time activities.

Some people opien that the gouvernement need to produce the food for people, that lives in this countrie. I think this point of view are alive cause people think, that they own gouvernement will live without the food. Also some peopl think so, because they opien that, they countries is the main on the whole world.

On the other hand, there are other point of view, that the import it’s also important for gouvernement. In my opinion, when some countries import the food they make some money, therefore this will be good for economics of this countries. In addition, when countries werk together it will be great for futre world situation. Also, we can ecck at the experiance when our country (Russia) was USSR, and when we didn’t contact with many other countrie, and aim to import as little as possible, and nevertheless we have a bed situation whith import.

In conclusion, to sum up, I would like to say that it is obvious, that countries should not aim to import, because it’s so important  for each countrie, consequently I claim that it’s easy to produce the food for import and for own populatont eats.

To begin with, most business and leisure air travel contributes to the economical state of the governments. The budget of the majority of hot countries depends on the tourism rates and the amount of people visting their country annually. For example, the southern european countries, such as Bulgaria and Greece, rely on the industries providing a wide range of service to tourists, comming round annually. The more the amount of visiters will be, the higher the government will earn.

Moreover, a lot of modernised air companies already meet ecological regulations, introducing eco-friendly designs, prohibiting overbooking and regularly rising costs in the most favourable tourism seasons.

I will try to explain why this happened and how parents and teachers can solve this problem.
First of all, i think the main problem is that young people have a lot of free time and instead of doing something useful they commit crimes, i think that happens because there is nothing to do in their cities and they tend to spend more time on the streets, which can be bad for them. Also, i thinks there are people who already criminals may be even their peers and they hang out together and their influence can easily lead to new crimes being done and even more criminals appearing on the streets.
Nevertheless, there are a couple of ways i can think of how this problem can be solved by teachers and parents. For example, teachers should make their subjects interesting for students so they would spend more time studying instead of just walking round the streets. What is more, teachers could start some extra classes like football by coach, or advanced chemistry by chemistry teacher that would fill all that time which is usually spend on the streets. Talking about parents i thinks they must pay more attention to their kids activities and who are their friends. That would reduce influence of those who are bad man. They can check who is in their kid's friend list in social networks in what activities they are involved because nowadays internet makes it really easy to control everyone.

In my opinion, there can be a lot of reasons for such growth of the problem. First of all, in our busy world many parents sometimes tend to pay not as much attention to the nursery of their children as parents did before. The ideas of goodness, correct behavior and etc are often not explained to children well enough. Beside that, social media propaganda of different cruel or dangerous things being “cool” or “fun” also plays it’s role. Young people very often cannot separate information on the one you should trust, and the one you should not. Also, supposedly, it could be because of the higher amount of stress which people receive nowadays in all age categories, or the eager of the young for adrenalin.
What society really can do to help the problem is to promote correct values and inform people of what happens when you commit a crime. Parents and teachers should make sure that their kids and student are aware of the consequences, and should explain why it is so important to follow the rules and the law, and show good examples themselves. I believe that when given the right knowledge young people cannot grow up into criminals.

For example, modern trains, such as “Supsan”, are both convenient and really fats, so it would be reasonable to use them ore often of they contribute less to air pollution and global warming. Secondly, a lot of flights are inefficient, because celebrites or governmental people use large personal planes which could potentially carry more passengers. As many of these flights are for leisure, governments should control their frequency when it is possible. However, some people argue that there are areas where moving by plane or helicopter is much easier than by train or by car. They also say that when the distance is long the speed difference between aircrafts and vehicles becomes more significant. I agree with them to some extent.

However, the tendency started to change: the number of people grew gradually during further 150 years.

Some people also argue that some social institution like school and family have to cope with this drastic increase.
I strongly agree with the first point while having several additions to the second in order to make a solution more complex and prevention more effective.
At first, among noteably wide groups of youths lawful actions and civilized behaviour considered sign of weakness. This has come from masculine traditions of the past and better survived in either closed racial communities, for example, people of color in USA, or in bad economic environment, for instance, in small towns of Central Rusia. It causes hatred and ganging (like in notorious LA gangs ""Bloods"" and ""Crips"") and class misunderstanding (rage against the well-off). At second, international distribution of wealth may provide newcomers with anxienty and willing to bury with the whole society in order to eliminate and get closer to benefits. We see that many young people consider their environment ghetto with ways away only in outlawed activities. Lifestyle of drugdealers known from massculture rends to be get serious and flawless causing massive addiction to rap industry with it's countinious deviso ""money, women and weed"". It makes drug making, and distribution with sexual harrasment the most widely spread problems of a generation.
From my point of view, the only way from this toxic features of modern society is to change seriously roadmap of budget expendtures for upcoming years. We have to change the roots of culture by either melting everybody at the same pot or provide with enough room for tradition self-identifying to mostly in religious way. However, cobblestone of tradition has been removed almost everywhere and we grew apart of.
I suppose, support of programs claryfying the positive outcome of education and self-development have to be put widely. We see one of the closest relation in economics, friendship between unemployment and crime rate. Youth themselves ful support of doing nothing and using public and family funds to pay checks. And see no way to get a job because of international competition with cheaper rivals from Asia. So we have to make them thinking that stereotype of getting out of poor by outlaw behaviour is unfair, that the only place under the sun reserved for hardworking specialists.
To make a long story short, the problem of young people getting trapped by outlaw behaviour is provided by tough solution of changing the way they understand opportunities.

That is why nowadays governments try to invent a beneficial system of rewarding for citizens to always have some capital in case of emergency. One of these experimental programs is “Guaranteed Basic Income”, promising a sum of money paid monthly to everyone, whether a person has work or not.
Obviously such a project has a vast number of advantages. Firstly, it guarantees life for everyone, recessing the spreading of poor and homeless population layers. Secondly, in the end the sum paid could be sent back to the government, stabilizing the taxes paying and the financial circulation in the bank system. Moreover, it would certainly improve the quality of life and strengthen the international authority of the country.
However, there are some evident disadvantages. To begin with, the monthly paid sum of money could discourage population from work at all. Let us take the example of modern France, where similar law, concerning only people without any job, encourages thousands of migrants and poor people to benefit from it. What is more, every initiative connected with money could collapse the financial system of no matter which country with no stable income.
Personally I do not suppose that such a suggestion could see the daylight, the disadvantages totally outweighing the benefits. On one hand, it requires a strong financial background of the country in question. On the other hand, this kind of program would appeals to lower classes, which would provoke its boost.
Finally, as long as financial problems are crucial, people will be inventing a huge range of methods to solve it equally for everyone.",7

Some people believe that consequence of using drugs by sportsmen should be denying participance of that athlet for limited period. While another part of people claim that punishment should be stricker - banning for the rest of their lives. This essay will demonstrate two different points of view.
Athletes should be given a punishment - 2 years without any competitons. People, that support that point of view, highlight situations when sportsmen didn't know that he used illegal drugs: for example, because of new rules or his doctor was not aware of essential information and gave illegal medicines. Another reason is that everyone, including sportsmen, has a chance for mistake and if sporstmes was punished, banned for some period of time, he would not try to do it again.
Although the majority claims that the althetes should be banned for 2 years, there is a group of people with contrary point of view. Sport is very fair part of live and using illegal drugs influence rules of sport. Moreover, that illegal medicines give more chances to win for participants from developed countries because they can provide their athletes contemporary drugs by modern techologies while developing countries cannot afford it because of lack of money and qualificated scholars. Furthermore, they believe that if sportman uses illegal drugs he broke rules of world sports community and could not be its member again.
Hence, I believe that if the athlet use drugs first time, he should be banned for 2 years but if more than once, he should be punished by banning for the rest of their lives. To sum up, that topic is very discussive nowadays and opponents are arguing till today.

Besides the enormous number of benefits, provided with that fact, there are still some drawbacks. The one is airplanes wastes, that pollute atmosphere and cause global warming.
One should not forget, that there are literally dozens of thousands of airplanes, which lift up and set down all over the world daily. Each of them burns fuel and therefore contributes wastes into the atmosphere. While being not heavy than air, these gases flow up and within tome being may cause Earth ozon shield destruction. That is why I strongly agree, that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of wastes, but not the amount of air travel itself.
To my mind, the general restriction in number of air flights would not affect anything, but the flight price, which is not the ultimate goal. Nowadays, air flights is a necessity and by reducing its number government will only increase the demand and therefore its price.
It goes without a doubt, that the reduction of amount of waste itself will solve the problem. So there are basically two ways to make it work: air flights number reduction and innovative ecologically friendly fuel. The first one is not the option as it has just been concluded. That is why I believe that innovative fuel is the future of air travel. For instance, the air plane, flying on solar energy, is now being tested. Of course, that kind of plane does not pollute air anyhow.

People of our country made all products and food by themselvs. And that is why the USSR was the greatest country in the world with ideal economic.

But if the government do something to change it, do something to less impor, our economic will get the second life.

Moreover, mobile, computer and TV screen affects our brain and destroys it through our eyes. For instance, I know people who have a frequent headache because of endless looking at their smartphones.

Firstly, the young generation is affected by new technologies more than others. So parents should make gaps for their children in using of mobile phones. At the same time, it is better to make kids read books because it’s more useful and developing activity. Secondly, it is necessary to invent harmless screens that would not destroy our eyes.

More and more people claim that teenagers have become more cruel than ever before.The statistics showes that more than 46% of youngsters were prosecuted and punished for commited crimes. It is vitaly important to decrease the number of crimes and then eradicate it at all. In this essay I will outline the causes of increased crime rates among teenagers and offer several solutions to eradicate the problem.

There are several reasions which influence the developing of crime among teens. The first reason is that the gun law was eased recently, so now it is much easier to buy the gun in the shop. Moreover, violent computer games have become widely spread and these games have a bad impact on youngsters' mental health. For young people,having committed a crime on computer many times,is more difficult to distinguish reality from fiction and if a teenager was offended, he or she can hurt someone just because they used to do it online.

Although the situation is complicated many things can be done to solve the problem. At first, special classes at schools, where students will be taught of alternative ways of solution a problem instead of usage of gun. MOre job offers can be given to youngsters at shcool, so they will be more busy and financially independent and will not steal the things they need. One more option is special restrictions in law, abolishing the usage of gun or knife in public places such as schools and shopping malls.
To conclude, it is vitaly important to solve the problem and many more issues can be taken. Having paid more attention to it the crime rates will be decreased significantly.",7

When people congratulate someone, it is quite common to wish happiness. But what do we mean by "" happiness""? What things can make a person happy?
It rather difficult to give happiness a strict definition. In fact it is hardly possible. The reason is that this concept is very subjective and it can be said that everyone has different things which can cause happiness. Also the problem is that happiness is a state of mind, it has psychological features, which make the definition even more complicated for the person who is not a specialist. 
Although it us hard to define happiness, some factors which can make people happy can be pointed out. In my opinion, first thing is love. As the Beatles sang ""Love is all you need"".  When a person fals in love, his or her mood becomes much better, everything seems great and easy. Family and friends are also very important. Is is widely known that it is easier to become depressed if you do not have strong personal relationships. 
One more thing is professional succes. If people go to work which they don't like, they are likely to be unhappy. And of course it is important to get satisfaction from the job. 
Also hobbies and art can make people enjoy their lives and become happy. Art often becomes a sense of life for people, they feel happy only if they create something. 
To summarise it can be said that different people have different things which make them happy. Some people look for somebody to love, others are in love with their jobs. Maybe, the greatest achievement in life is to find something that makes you happy and brings you joy. It will undoubtedly make your life more interesting and worth living.

In comparison we can see that manufactured goods and food products are two mainly transported good by road. If we make a comparison betwee two ways of transportation, we will observe that transporting machinery  by rail is bigger in six times. By the way, the amount of manufactured goods are the approximately the same. Chemicals being transporting by rail are a little bit smaller that transporting by road.

Some people argue that part of flights for business and leisure is unnecessary, so governments should think about new laws to decrease the number of them. However, I suppose that this will harm society.

All of us are sometimes using planes as the mean of transport because it is easy, quick and comfortable way of travelling even on long distances. Air travel made our lifes easier as we don’t need to spend months or even year to get from one place to another as it was centuries ago. Also we have opportunities to visit places that were untouched before. The costs of plane ticket are rather small so almost everybody can afford it. So if governments decide to cut down the number of flights, the cost of air travel will rise up rapidly and this will cause unability of some group of people to afford it. This may be harmful for their business if they have to travel often or if their family lives in the other part of the world. Moreover, it may affect pilots as a lot of them will be fired if the number of flights and air companies don’t need so much work force.

On the other hand, the reduce of amount of the air travel may help to solve problems with air pollution and prevent future global warming as less planes will flight. However, I believe that this wouldn't make dramatic change in the problem of pollution as there are a lot of other things that harm our planet.

In conclusion I'd like to say that cutting down the amount of flights by introducing new laws may affect the air pollution but not greatly, while life of people may become uncomfortable and a lot of them will loose their job.

Will this policy make more good than bad? This is what I’m going to speculate about in this essay.
It’s undeniable fact that the world has been undergoing huge economic downturns, that’s why nowadays it’s extremely difficult to find a job even for people with high education. The number of the unemployed has escalated drastically and it’s projected to rise. So in this case it’s quite a reasonable idea to provide people with even minimal extent of money so they can overcome these times and survive. Correspondingly, such policy may prevent death fatalities such as suicides, for example, since it’s a well-known fact that most of the times people tend to commit suicide when encountering financial problems.
Despite the fact that such program seems to be quite beneficial, it has some downsides too. First of all, the number of unemployed people will grow dramatically since there won’t be any reason for them to find a job. For example, such governmental programs exist in some countries in Europe. Almost the most part of the population is homeless people, who live for money given by government, so that there are even vast swaths of the cities of poor people. Last but not the least, even though such program will be created, it doesn’t guarantee the stability and prosperity of the country and the gap between the poor and the wealthy will still be the problem of high importance.

Consequently, musicians and film producers suffer huge losses from this illegal actions.

Secondly, I think that distribution of pirate copies can hurm the author. For example, fans of Twilight saga hacked computer of the author, Stephanie Mayer and and shared in the Internet her book.

One of the solutions suggested is to keep criminals in prisons for longer periods than now. In my opinion, however, this would not help much and some other measures should be taken.  On the one hand, the idea of giving longer prison sentences seems to be reasonable. First of all, people would be more frightened of punishment, since they would know that they might spend nearly the whole life in prison for the crime. Further, some of the criminals do not change in prison and might bring new troubles to the society after the end of the period spent in prison. It could be also suggested, that if such opportunities would be provided they might study and work in prison and gradually change their views.  On the other hand, this solution is arguable and to me personally does not seem to be very convincing. It should be stressed, that this idea is not humanistic, as long prison sentences do not give the criminals tha chance to start new life after the end of the sentence. Next, as the reserchers show, in some countries where the sentences were rather long the crime rate did not change significantly. Finally, from my point of view, such measures would make people in general much more depressed, as Christianity, for example, learns us to forgive, and many people are religious nowadays.  To sum up, after discussing both these views, it could be said that such measures seem to be too radical and may shock the society. In my opinion, what should be done instead, are the attempts to raise the level of education, of life in general, to make it more comfortable to live in big cities and to encourage people to communicate more not only with their relatives or friends, but also with other citizens. I would also like to suggest to raise the public awareness of the problem of the high crime level, as alternative ways to improve the situation may be found.",7

As far as I am concenred, there are two main causes of such a phenomenon. They are lack of attention towards young people and the increase in the amount of cruelty around them.
First, there are many parents working a lot, so that they cannot pay a lot of attention to their children. In this case kids do not get enough moral education, and a lack of that can result into a child becoming cruel, as he or she does not know what good and bad is.
Also, such kids can feel underloved by their parents, which can contribute to their future violence. In addition, there is an unbelievable amount of external cruelty around kids these days. They watch movies and play computer games that consist mostly of scenes of shooting, and other types of harrasment. Spending their leisure time this way causes problems with moral standards and extreme violence. All the aformentioned factors result into yound people growing up very violent, which is one of the key factors of the increase in the number of crimes committed by young people.
As this issue is extremely important for the society, parents and teachers definitely should do something to decrease the level of kids' cruelty to prevent them from becoming criminals. The most important thing they can do is to pay more attention towards children's development and their moral education. Kids should be taught about good and bad from the very young age, and they should feel that they are cared about. In this way, they will be much less likely to experience willingness to commit a crime. In order to reach such a goal, parents and teachers should control the media products that children consume to avoid the situation, in which they watch horrors only. They should suggest that children read more books and watch more movies that will establish right moral values an teach them how to behave.
To sum up, more crimes commited by young people are caused by the huge amount of violence affecting them, which comes from both media products they tend to consume and from the lack of their parents' attention.

It is clear that the year temperatures rates in Brazil remained above zero degrees in the contrast to the same temperature numbers in Russia due to the climate differences in two semispheres. While in Rio de Janeiro the average lowest temperatures fluctuated slightly around 20C during the whole period, in Yakutsk the minimum numbers rose from -40C in January to almost 10C in the middle of the summertime, then falling dramatically to the primary state in the beginning of winter.

The same pattern may be related to the proportions of the highest temperature rates in the two cities. Whereas the year maximum numbers in Rio de Janeiro stayed almost stable at 30C, just falling to 25C from March to October, in Yakutsk the maximum temperatures rates increased significantly from -40C in January, peaking at 20C in July, and fell back to the original numbers in december.",7

What is for machinery, these goods were mostly moved by rail transport: 12% compare to 2% by the road. Speaking of rail transportation, it is obvious from the pie chart, that the great part of whole transportation is metals which consist 35% of general rail moving.

Regarding the highest level of tempereture, we can see that the temperature in Rio de Janeiro reaches its peak of 30 degrees above zero in January. Maximum temperature curve then dipps slightly to approximately 25 degrees in May, fluctuating during further 4 months just around 25 degrees (from May to September). Temperature rate rises steadily during 4 months till the end of the year, returning to its initial level of just around 30 degrees. Maximum temperature rate in Yakutsk starts with around 35 degrees below zero at the beginning of the year, increasing gradually to its highest level of around 25 degrees above zero in July, which is the warmest month of a year. Temperature curve declines during all 6 months left, falling down from plus 25 degrees to almost 35 degrees below zero.

Turning to the minimum temperature figures, we can notice, that the curve follows the same pattern in both cases, copying maximum rank curve's principle. While looking at the Rio's curve, it should be said, that the gap between maximum and minimum figures remains almost the same, having approximately 7 degrees distance. The highest minimum temperature is seen in February (just above plus 25 degrees), while the lowest is detected in July (around 17 degrees respectively).Yakutsk's minimum temperature line follows the same pattern as in the previous case: temperature rank plummets steadily from minus 40 degrees in January to just above plus 10 degrees in July, dipping to the initial level of 40 degrees below zero in December.

In summary, it can be concluded, that average temperature progress in Rio (Brazil) differs from Yakutsk's progress greately. Rio's temperature curve roughly remains at the same level during the whole year, fluctuating from 30 to 25 degrees of the maximum level and from 25 to 17 degrees of the minimum level respektively.Yakutsk's temperature curve has a marked peak both by the maximum and minimum temperature level in July.",7

For them, plane or helicopter is an usual sort of transport that can be expluatated to go to the luxury doubled harmful impact of airplanes to our environment. In these reasons, of course, air travel should be reduced or forbidden.
But on the other hand, it is known that plane s the safetiest type of transport. There is lower level of accidents involving this type of travelling compared with cars or ships. Furthermore, going by plane is the fastest way to achieve every corner of the world.

So, the fact of reduction the amount of air travel will definitely go to transport collaps. It leads to people’s disappointment and unsatisfied reaction to government decision.

This essay will express a point of disagreement with the issue presented. First of all, I would like to provide a brief overview, and, after that, I will add my personal standpoint.

To begin with, it is fair to mention the fact that doing sport in general can be regarded as a rather time-consuming hobby as well as simple watching games and matches.The tendency towards such a 'passive' way of participating is growing more and more popular, which has led to a great amount of agrument; whether it is worth doing at all. I adhere to the point that being involved into the world of sport even by just supporting your favorite teams may have a number of advantages. The first reason to support the idea is that people become more and more aware of the news connected with the particular area. In the long run, followers are likely to turn into active participants since they already have not only a practical constituent, but also a sufficient theoretical basis.
Moreover, sport events seem to be a really widespead topic for a heated discussion, which beneficially contributes to the development of social skills.
To sum up, it should be pointed out that people are provided with quite prospective opportunities when watching games and being a spectator at a stadium, even though it is sometimes acknowledged to be of no use.",6

It is necessary to provide the students of both sexes with an equal amount of places on each faculty, or can some certain gender traits have an impact on that proportion?

In my opinion it is important that the universities provide both male and female students with an equal access to the exams and faculty places. It is clear that nowadays women have become more confident and are not afraid to participate in the competitions with their male counterparts. Right after the 19th century feminist movement women acquired many rights firstly reserved specifically for men, including the right to study. If a woman can study in the chosen field she can make a good career for herself applying her knowledge appropriately.

Also the division of subjects on «male» and «female» ones is quite ridiculous as it doesn’t consider the talents of each given individual. If a man wants to be a poet or a designer or a teacher it doesn’t that he will grow to be less masculine in the same fashion as the woman who chooses to study engineering or mathematics doesn’t lose her femininity. Everyone should be able to follow their dream and the faculty choice is the first step towards its relation.

On the whole I argue that all the universities should decide weather to allow or not each given student to study in the certain subject judging not by their gender but by their knowledge and eagerness.

Governments of many countries spend enormous amount of money on relevant researches, whereas a lot of other problems, such as poverty, hunger or environmental issues are still not solved. So, it is not surprising that many people think that spending money on space exploration is pointless and it would be better to work on solving more urgent problems in society.

I believe that it is a quite fair opinion. Firstly, it is not smart to spend a huge part of country's budget on space exploration when the economic situation in your country is not very stable. For example, in the last three years Russia did a few unsuccessful experiments with cargo spacecrafts (one of them was ""Progress""). These failures cost milliards and it is hard not to get angry when you think about possibility of spending these money on improving medicine or education in Russia. Secondly, the fast progress in this field of researches is not possible without common technical progress, so, spending a huge amount of money on in just makes no big sense for countries, which have not so impressive background and not well-developed technical industry. It is sad, but I am talking about Russia again: in my opinion, the country, which imports most of the technical products, just is not able to be truly successful space power.

However, it is hard to say that we do not need space exploration at all. It is well known that natural resources are not endless and one of the possible decisions of this problem is colonization of other planets. So, it is smart to start thinking about it right now. But, in my opinion, only the countries with stable economic situation can allow and have to allow themselves to spend big money on such researches and experiments: for example, I think that at this moment Elon Musk is one of the most important people for the humanity because of his space projects.

All in all, humanity obviously needs space exploration, but it is important to set priorities wisely and not think about space too much when your country has another urgent problems.",7

I suggest, that every person wants to live in the safety environment, takes a deep breath with clear air and other, that’s why we should to do possible accomodations for its deal. Firstly, people live in a high-technical world, where we connect with different parts of the countries or continend, that’s why it isn’t very vital to fly by plane for conferences. For example, businessmen can discuss their problems with help of Skype. Moreover, this programme allows not only to speak with partner on the other side of screen, but also and see the person. I think it is very great and convient. Secondly, nowadays political position is dangerous and a lot of type of air travelling are damaged. Besides, these unrecognizable sutuations kill huge amount of human lifes. Although, I thinks this problem is solved by protection of local measures. For example, people, who have own deal or business, should to introduce or share with companies in this country, where live. This way allows to protect air atmosphere and own production, companies, fabricks. Thirdly, also we have other facilities to go to the university, between different towns, to spend leisure activities such as by train, by bus or by car. All of these are more safe  than planes, and a lot of people are frightened by a huge amount of kilometres from the ground.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, people choose, as a way of transportation, air travelling, because it is more faster. Secondly, sometimes accidents are happined by independent conditions of you, that’s why you have a little time to prevent catastrous..

People often go on holiday in other country by plane in other country by plane because it is the only way to visit a country which is far away. For example, if Russian people want to go to America they will not use a train or a bus because of a big distanation and ocean some people can say that people should travel in nearest places.

Nevertheless it is clear that air pollution by planes is significant. They consume a huge amount of fuel and then emit it in the air. The damage from which the environment.Suffers is great and the most essential point is that we can’t fix it. 
I think that the solution may be found easily. The governments should ban all air travels for short distances. At the same time they have to develop introstructures for example, make trains to go faster or to buid roads for speed moving. 
In conclusion I would like to say, that plane is a good mean of transport and it should not be prohibited at all. We must find ways to use planes more seldom to save our planet Earth.

The system should also prevent further crimes and, accordingly, a question arises whether longer prison sentences are efficient. Some people believe that the longer a sentence is, the more fear it evokes in the souls of potential criminals. Prison is considered to be hell on earth and it is supposed that a person would try to avoid it by all means if the sentence is long enough. Furthermore, longer sentences prevent a person from having a normal lifestyle for more years, which can be a terrifying perspective. Apart from that, dangerous prisoners could be kept away from society for a longer time and, therefore, cease to threaten life of people. On the other hand, prison changes a person rapidly so that criminals adjust to life there. It is obvious that prison alters people not depending on the length of the sentence. In addition, a lot of workforce kept in prisons doing manual work would not contribute to the economic welfare of a country. Moreover, longer sentences mean higher expences for a state, which can also have a negative impact on the economy. Consequently, economic instability may lead to crime rates increasing. Thus, this measure may turn out to be counterproductive. To my mind, longer sentences would not be efficient in reducing crime. I presume that introducing an improvesd system of fines is a more reasonable and plausible solution. Not only do they punish criminals and prevent people from committing further crimes, but they also can become a source of income for a country.",8

It is rather challenging and thought-provoking issue which should be taken into account by parents and teachers.

I suppose that an abundance of factors can cause this problem. Firstly, many children receive poor attention from their parents today because both parents usually work full time nowadays. They would like to earn money, however, they forget about attention and care which their child needs. Secondly, such problem can be rooted in spread of video and computer games. Children and teenagers are getting used to cruelty and violence through electonic games. The boundaries between games and reality begin to blur. That is why they transfer actions from games into real life.

Parents and teachers should definetely discuss this problem in detail and come to a common agreement. I can suggest some possible solutions. The first one is to spend more free time with their children, to talk to them and to be interested in their lifes. The second thing which adults can do is to organise special activities for children where they will be under control. With the help of such activities they will learn to communicate with peers and distinguish between real and virtual life.

To conclude it can be said that although the problem is wide-spread today, there are plenty of solutions which can be offered. Parents and teachers should just pay enough attention to it.",7

It is argued that contestants that were proven to consume illegal drugs should not ever be allowed to participate in competition while another point of view suggests that penalty shouldn't be so strict and should last only several years. This essay will overview both opinions and make a conclusion.
Some people believe that sportsmen that were caught cheating once would continue to use steroids and other means of increasing their physical possibilities even after few year of disqualification. Sadly, sport industry has know such cases. First places at professional competitions bring loads of money, and that is the reason why athlets continue to commit crimes. Banning unfair stars could open a way to young and ambitious people who could be more interested in honest competition.
The opposite argument is that disqualification shouldn't be permanent. Certainly, cheating is a serious crime but does is really deserves such punishment? Professional athlets put all their lives to achieve success, and all their aspirations are connected with sport triumphs. They often can't do anything else except their profession, so leaving a career forever might mean an end to all their perspectives. The other point is that any separete disqualifications. no matter how long they are don't solve the whole problem of illegal drugs use. Much more serious sleps shoud be taken to cope with such issue, the whole system should be overlooked and reformed.
To sum up, drugs use in sport remains a serious problem. life-long penalty has some minor benefits but it doesn't change the whole situation. Neither does short ban for two years although permanent ban could keep more competitors from unfair game.

But when they have chance to get it for free they find their favourite bands, songs and give chance for unknown musiciants become famous. There are thousands examples of bands who gives their music for free, they find it like a way to introduce their art to huge auditory Anyway the main part of musician money is money from tickets, that means if more people will hear you, more people will come to the show and band will get more money.
That’s how pirates help bands and whole industry. The only chance for groups to make a lot of money is to make good music and great shows. Also I like the Idea how Apple solve problems with pirates, they make all music on Apple music free, but enter for month costs some money, this is one more way to overcome problem.

By the way, transporting food by the road is more popular than transporting it by rail (30% to 10%). So, we can think that road transport is more fast than rail-transport (trains), because food is fast-dying material, and speed of transportation is general factor.

Also, a lot of manufactured goods are transported by road, but the pretty same percent is transported by rail (25% to 28%). In other categories, there is same percent, except metal, 35% of all road transporting system are remove metals from place to place.

Modern society demands effective ways of handling with this problem, for instance, the increase of the length of inprisonment. But whether it is a reasonable and beneficial desision is a controversial issue worth discussing.

Many people claim that if criminals stay in prison for a longer period of time, it would result in the more peaceful life in the city. To begin with, it is quite unlikely that the short punishment might change the person. It is essential to make him/her reflect long enough about the crime they commited and give them time to get psyhological treatment if needed. In addition, the longer criminals are isolated the safer is the city environment, these people do not respect the rules of our society and they do not deserve to be the part of it. Moreover, in prisons people are offeed different work-programms, they may even master a new job and later, after a long term become more efficient members of our society.

However, some people do not share this point of view and state that the increased length of inprisonment is not a way out. Firstly, government spends too much money on criminals, when they live in jail. These resourses could be used on a better purpose. Secondly, the people are different and staying for a long period in a cruel and pressing prison environment might be fatal for week personalities. People will not realise their mistace, on the contrary - they can become more violent. Thirdly, with the development of modern psychology, it is possible to create an individual programms for each prisoner, find his/her own way to a new better life.

In conlusion, in a modern society the long isolation of criminals cannot be an effective desision. Personally, I think it is more imporant to find a way to prevent people from becoming criminals. Hopefully, it the future the political and economic situations in the country will be improved and people will be satisfied with their lives, because it this case crimes are not nessecary.",7

People either buy discs or download music and films from the Internet. The latter is a problem for musicians and film producers. Some people think that using the Internet for such purposes is a crime, while others support anouther point of view. 
To begin with, music and films are financed with a lot of money and using them without buying would lead to financial problems for musicians and film producers. If producers do not get profit from making a movie, they will not have money for new projects. Moreover, film industry consists not only of producers and actors. Also, there are the owners of cinemas who will not be able to continue their business if everyone will use the Internet for downloading films.
Nevertheless, some critics believe that people should have free access to music and films. Firstly, there is an opinion, that art should be free for every person because it gives people an opportunity to learn more about the world. For example, some films could be used in schools for making edicational process more interesting for children. Secondly, there are people who do not have enough money for buying music discs or films. For instance, children or disabled people usually do not have enough money to buy new films and music. Nevertheless, they may need to listen to music or watch films in order to have common topics for talking with people in society.
To sum up, there are different reasons for downloading music and films instead of buying them. The Internet provides a lot of opportunities for people, however, musicians and film producers face with some problems. Thus, this question remains controversial.

This is a matter of debate with several strong points both for and against. However, in my opinion, people can not deny that those characteristics have much more influence of their lives than any future life experiences.
Firstly, it is important to take into consideration both aspects: physical and mental. Speaking of physical characteristics we are born with, those can be changed during life, while it is much more difficult to change mental characteristics. Of course you can try to change something in yourself, make yourself better, nevertheless it is extremely rare for a person to change entirly. There are some exceptions talking about extrodinary life experiences, heavy emotional dramas, mental illnesses, but those took place very rare in people’s life.
Another fact I would like to draw attention to is that we often are guided by the characteristics we are born with while going through any experience, even if we do not notice this. (As a fact, people can change a bit when going through adolesense, but after that if we do not feel the desire to change we usually do not.) Thus the characteristics we are born with influence even our life experiences sometimes.

First of all, nowadays  the majority of airports offer a lot of type of planes with extra comfort options which contain less passengers while the level of damaging effect stay the same. For example, a lot of businessmen have private planes, which are comparable with the size of usual plane, but they use them for travelling with small number of people, like collegues or family, as frequent as usual plane is used.

Secondly, the reducing of the amount of business and leisure air travel could make more popular eco-friendly types of travel, such as, trains or electrocars.

Sometimes students cannot to start relationships between each other. Then they feel stress and uncomfortable. It can be cause of problem behaviour too.

Personally I think that ecology needs more attention from people, and we should think about ways to deal with hafmful effects of such transport like airplanes.
The air travels are not the only way to transfer. All other types of transport developed actively, so people have an opportunity to choose it. For example, high speed trains can go through long distance faster, then a few years earlier. Moreover, such type of transport often is more comfortable and safe, so people can feel calm and peace in it. People with mental illnes like phobies are already feel it.
Society have to live in unit with nature. Ecological problems influence our planet, and we, as a huge part of its habitants, feel this effects. When we choose between our short comfort and the long term effects on nature, we need to think twice, because it is hard to fix problems like pollution and its results.

I agree that goverment must give more freedom in art ideas because artist's mission on the Earth is provide and develop people's imagination, view on their life and belive. All countryes rules control express of creative people idea.


For example, in North Korea geverment control, moreover forbit it as a result. Local population have same ideas, same lifestyle, same thinking. They do not have their own opinion, because afterwards it suppres gestures. Keeping in jail or killing. Of course it stop process of develop contry's social life.

At the same time, the amount of air travels is constantly growing. Many people believe that government should make legal limits for leisure and business travel to cope with ecological problems. I am strongly agree with this opinion and will give some essential reasons in this essay.

Firstly, we are the only one who make the world for our children. It has been proven but many scientists and even international corporations that if we will not be more serious with ecological problems today, it will be impossible to live in this planet in near future. So, each of us should do something to save this planet.

Furthermore, travel limitation is important step to prevent air pollution and global warming and what is more important this step is possible to make today. Business air trips should be limited because in modern world there are many other way to deal with international business, like Skype-conference. Speaking about leisure travelings, here limitations could be made. But at the same time people need an opportunity to travel. So these limitations should be quite line for people, for example only once a year. Moreover, other ways of traveling should become cheaper at the same time.

To sum up, steps to save our planet and prevent air pollution and global warming need to be made right now and reduction of amount of leisure and business air travel with government limitation is one of these steps. So, in my personal opinion people should think about our planet and fly on planes less.

Although the government is trying to fight this in collaboration with parents, the number of legal violations has become alarming in the recent years. In this essay, I will outline the causes of this tendency and provide some possible solutions.
First of all, teenagers require a lot of care and attention. When they are being ignored by their family and friends, youngsters resort to crime in order to be noticed. A possible way to change this situation is introducing certain team-building activities for families to return trust among their members. For example, it is possible to start an organization that sets up retreats where families do activities that reqire support and understanding or have honest discussions where everyone listens to each other's viewpoint.
Secondly, a lot of adolescents are urged to make life-changing decions at a very young age, like choosing their future profession. This puts them under an incredible amount of stress, so they rebel against the norms of society and choose an alternative, albeit illegal, way of providing for themselves. In this situation parents and teachers should provide psychological help and assist teenagers in choosing their path. Lectures and talks with successful people from various professional fields, organized by the school staff, as well as parents encouraging children to explore their talents will make youngsters more ambitious and career-minded.
Taking everything into consideration, although teenagers sometimes stray from the appropriate lifestyle, which is accepted by the society, it is the responsibility of elder mentors to help the young to understand who they are and choose their future accordingly.",8

The main reason for this should probably be, that USA and Great Britain are basically the countries where film industry was created, and so it has thrived and developed for a very long time there. But when the countries which didn't develop their industry try to simply copy the work and the methods of western movie giants, they are doomed to fail. Because making a work of such high quality demands one to be experienced.
Of course, one can blame the governments for not funding their own film industry and giving local movies extra time in the theatres, which in their opinion is the only true reason for being worse than West.
I certainly can't agree with such a position. First of all, my country does fund the movies, but as holds for any sort of funding, especially in the art, which movies are a kind of, one can't expect the final product to be great, if one invested their money unwisely. Which is exactly what happens in my country. It's actually a matter of finding good crew. As is apparent in my country all of the normal script writers seem to be doing something else. Because the main weakness of our movies is their scripts. It's actually even more bizarre considering all the money invested.
As to sum up, maybe governments indeed should give more financial support to film industries, but they should certainly do so with great caution, as we have already seen the sad results of unwisely invested money.",8

There is some evidance to suggest that many health problems are the result of using technolody. According to scientists, invention of computers and addiction young gereration to them destroy their health. An example to support the thesis is an increasing number of teenagers with problems of the sight. Moreover, the environment has tendency to deteriorate that will lead to diseases of people. As the matter of fact, the use of cars causes the pollution and shortage of fresh air.
The problems are an enormous widespread and they should be solved. There are several ways to resolve the acute problems. One of them is the intervention of the government that can impose taxes or implement draconian measures. For example, through taxes number of cars would be decreased and issue of pollution will be resolved in some extent. Furthermore, people should controlled the behaviour of their children. It will be a good idea to decrease the time of use phones and computers. Walking with children, playing active games outside, going to countries can be a significant measures to minimize a harmful influences of modern technology.
In conlusion, it should be empohasised that there is negative effect of technolody. Nevertheless, peole and government are available to reduce it.

Allegedly, the number of crimes committed by young people has increased and, therefore, something has to be done to stop this tendency. In this essay I will discuss the problem and try to come up with certain solutions.

Firstly, the reason for young people committing crimes might lie in their mental health. One of the urgent problems at schools in the twenty first century is bullying. Many youngsters become victims of bullies, they suffer from constant jokes and sometimes can even get beaten up. As a consequence, they want to express their anger which may come out in a form of a crime. An example for this can be found in multiple records of how pupils came to schools and shot their classmates. The possible solution may include bringing up this issue in schools and create some kind of movement against bullying. This might make bullying seem unappealing and, therefore, less popular. As a result, the number of crimes triggered by this facet will decline.
Secondly, many young people fail to get along with their parents and sometimes can do things just to make them mad, or because of constant fights. This happens due to the fact that family is quite important in the life of every human, so when you feel you are not loved and understood, you want to substitute it somehow. The point is that many youngsters commit crimes in order to get attention from their parents or to prove them something. So, the best solution one can think of here would be creating a warm atmosphere at home where teenagers could feel loved and supported. Parents should try to understand the problems of being a teenager and try to help their children go through this period reducing the number of stressfull situations as often as possible.

To sum up, many crimes young people commit stem from problems they have in school and family which are the most significant institutions in the life of a teenager. That is why both teachers and parents should be aware of the hurdles youngsters are facing and try to help them in all the possible ways.",8

Many historical events such as wars make governments think more about their economy and overall supplies. One factor of this equation is food. Some people believe that their country only needs to produce the food that their own population eats and shouldn’t import as much, or at least aim to import as little as possible. There are many opinions on this controversial topic.

From one perspective, some people may claim food production an expensive means of  supply, requiring costs in both time and money, however making local production to be a first priority goal because doing so strengthens the economy by providing working places with an additional patriotic bonus. Furthermore, creating own food provides a sustainable resource while being independent from third parties or other countries. 

On the other hand, experts claim that political influence is neglible compared to immense benefits food importing provides. First of all, your working class becomes free (at least partially) from one duty being constant and reliable food supply, thus creating opportunities for more expensive industries. Moreover, political relationships are more positive than negative with the result being mutually benefitial deals between countries that can excessively produce food, and those who cannot.

All in all, this is a controversial question to be answered differently by every country. In my opinion, importing should be generally preferred because among all, it also benefits customers, and sometimes, the positive effects of economic trade deals become visible by the general population, reflecting in its well-being.

Firstly, modern childerns are have to find a way to entartain themselves, so a most of them choosing to watch TV or sit in the Internet. But without the parental advisory they will soack a massive amount of negative and bad information which can lead to ruin their psychical health. With that, they will may never become a “normal” person in society and all their lives they will insist in special places or clinics. Secondly, spend a less time with your children means that it will not be grown up as a parent whants him to be. For example, if somebody whants from their children to continue a family business of to work in a particulat kind of job, where two or even more generations of a family members spent their lives then it is necessary to learn your baby from the beginning of his life because otherwise he will learn by himself and will choose a career in which he suits in the best way.

And now, when young people crime rates are higher than ever before, government and society are interested in the causes of the sudden increase in the level of crimes commited by young people and in the ways of solving this problem. This essay states that the causes of this development can be found in exsessive control of the young people and that the logical solution of this problem is to give them more freedom in their actions.
Before thinking about how to solve the problem we should understand the reasons why it did appear. As it was stateted above, the reason of the increase in crime rates by young people is the exsessive control of them from parents and teachers. The latter in order to provide education, right behavior, and safety restrict a lot of things: from watching cruel TV-shows to visiting some places and communication with their friends. The reaction of young people is the protest against such norms. To show that they do not agree with the way parents and teachers bring them up, they do something prohibited. And this has resulted in breaking the law. 
In order to solve this problem parents and teachers should accept a paradoxical thing: to lower the young people crime rates we should give them more freedom and stop to control them exsessively. Indeed, if teenagers were given more freedom in their actions, they would be happier and more satisfied with their current life and environment and would not try to do something prohibited to express their protest.
Parents and teachers, in their attempt to give a proper education, manners and behavior to teenagers, have reached the opposite thing - the increase in the level of crimes committed by them, because breaking the law is the protest agains exsessive control. Of course there are other reasons why young people have begun to break the law more often, but his one is the most important and requires an immediate solution.

Some people are sure that downloading the new song of Rihanna will not cause problems, while others are against copying and sharing at all. 

From my point of view, copies should be banned. Firstly, when you buy a disk with films or song, you show the respect to the author. Secondly, it motivates a singer of a film director to make more films or organize more concerts to show new pieces of art and culture.Thirdly, you give them a chance to improve their skills of renew musical instruments. It is very difficult to stay long term inspired without money.

Nevertheless, sometimes copies are quite useful because you do not need to save money for that DVD with “The beauty and the beast”. You can watch it at home at any time. Moreover, the system of buying original pieces of art will not work in Russia, where copying is almost a mainstream.

However, I strongly convinced that we should motivate artists of all spheres with money because no one motivation is better nowadays.

To sum up, I would like to stress out again that copying and sharing harms the person, whose songs you listen or whose films appreciate, - that’s why it is important to buy original discs. All work even mental and cultural should be paid.

Moreover, the percentage use of Facebook in the least age group, 65+ years old, is higher than any of the scored reached by the highest age groups in Instagram or LinkedIn, making Facebook even more popular with the crowd. 
Besides, it is noticeable that the age group of 65+ years has the smallest percentage use of all the three social networks, suggesting the fact that elderly people are least interested in any of them.
Finally, LinkedIn turns out to be the only social network in which the percentage use of the 30-49 age group is higher than this of the 18-29 age group, which might be a proof for the fact that middle-aged people are more interested in a professional social network than in an entertaining one, whilst younger people seem to have less passion in it.

To begin with, almost all people can visit airport or its site to see the influence of airplanes on our environment. This problem is critical to our society and some measures and improvments have been done, but some advantages are not used widely by all firms in this economic sphere. Consequently, authorities should first of all reduce the harm of air transport using current results of the development of knowledge and science and not shorten the volume of the air industry. At the same time air transport is very young comparising with rail, car or water methods of travelling. So that when government will try to cure the environment by restricting the industry it should start with leisure part. In this way, the society will not lose positive effects of the development of business which in future also can be changed toward right working system. To conclude, I would like to say that authorities have a lot of intensions to solve described problem in nearest future, but hopefully polliticians will come together with a right set of measures which will cooperate and will create an environment friendly industry.

Statistics show that the number of crimes committed among young people has increased during the latest years. In this essay I will provide some reasons for that fact and variants of how to deal with that.

Firstly, it is clear that the modern generation of teenagers and young people is completely different form what was 20 or 30 years ago. More and more young people come form deprived communities or families with only one parent, many of them are used to violence and home abuse. This fact, obviously, could not reflect on person's upbringing in a positive way. The second reason is connected to the age of technologies. Every day with the help of mass media and social networks we are bombarded with tons of information and news about murders, robbery, car stealing, kidnapping and so on. In my opinion, it could be considered as a propaganda and could have a bad influence on young people's minds and behaviour.

It goes without saying that this problem needs to be solved as the safety of people is on stake. Probably, some measures can take place at schools, for instance, a short course for all the students on a current situation explaining there is no significant reason to become a criminal. The situation with bulling at schools should be taken under control, as well. Additionally, some courses could be organised for parents because they are the ones responsible for their children's upbringing including their mindsets. As far as I am concerned, people who lacked love and care in their childhood are more likely to become criminals. And finally, the government could make a police control and protecting services more strict and more attentive.

To sum everything up, this problem creates the bond between all the people because most of the criminals have no other choice, it is the only way they can survive in a modern world. That is why it is crucial to understand that the criminal issue has more deep roots starting from our society.",6

From biological point of view, genes play the most important role in the process of formation of a person, while sociologists and psychologists believe that environment and life experience have greater influence than any genetic characteristics. I tend to support the sociologist's pointview, and below I am going to give arguments for that.
To begin with, it worths mentioning that in the second half of the 20th century there was a great interest in this question and some important studies were conducted. Researchers found twins who were separated in their childhood and growned up in very different social environment. What did they found is that social factors such as some characteristics of neighbourhood, parent's jobs, and early life experience had greater influence on later life than any biological factors. Even though the difference in their impact wasn't considerable, it indicates that with equal set of genes people's future depends on their socialisation process.
Looking deeper into process of socialisation, it could be stated that some ""life shocks"" in early childhood had a significant impact on person's personality. These life shocks include death of a relative, poverty, the lose of a house or bancropcy of a parent, and more others. After facing one or more of these circumstances, child might find herself or himself in a changing and unfamiliar environment. This, in turn, could provoke major changes in his or her personality. Since the nature of the ""life shocks"" is social and noone is secured from them, we can conclude that social component is very important to the process of the develompent of the individual.
Therefore, I reckon that environment is more important then genes, since even slight change in it could be followed by a great change in one'a personality.

Recent data reveals that more and more adolescents get involved in crimes, therefore the problem requires quick and efficient solution. In this essay we will discuss the major reasons of such statistics and identify prospective means using which teachers and parents could fight this trend.
Needless to say, our world is full of contraversies and dangers, so young people are frequently exposed to illegal activities. To begin with, development of Internet and social networks weakens parent’s ability to bring up their children properly. The Web which content is not always law-abiding and positive greatly impacts teenager’s worldview. Second, crimes and violence have already become a part of the mass-culture and these ideas are further developed by blockbusters and video-games. Finally, recent economic difficulties damaged family well-beings, consequently young people might have been commiting crimes for economic purposes. To sum it up, I assume that improper cultural environment, questionable leisure activities and financial factor aggravate the problem of adolescent crime.
I strongly believe that joint efforts of teachers and parents are indespensable for eliminating youth’s criminal activity. As I have mentioned above the perspective roots of the problem lie in the area of leisure time and economic environment, so these matters should be prioritized. Most of the crimes are likely commited out of school, so parents and teacher should ensure that adolescent’s free time is passed properly. Introduction of extra-curriculum activities that focus on communication and personal development (for instance, sports, drama classes etc.) would alter teenagers schedule and drastically decrease the risk of wrong-doings. As for - contraversial values shown in mass-culture, parents and teachers should educate the young on such issues as law-abideness and public safety. In case people are fully aware of the grim consequences of criminal offense they would less likely commit it. Deteriorating economic conditions detriment adolescent’s quality of life, consequently households and schools could request the local authorities to finance afore-mentioned initiatives to cut the crime rate.
All in all, the problem of crime among the youth remains vitally significant and should be tackled with urgency it deserves. To reverse such a negative trend parents and teachers should implement a coherent set of measures that eliminate underlying causes of misconducts and wrongdoing committed by adolescents.

However, there are people who believe that we should decrease the number of flights in order to protect the enviroment. To my mind, many other ways to solve problem of polluting air might be found.
To begin with, air pollution is result of a flawful technology that could be improved. There was a breakthrough in the evolution of technologies recently that continues to expedite every day. Moreover, more and more companies including those that are responsible for air transfer start following the ""green trend"" which means that they try to adjust their products to new high ecological standarts. For example, they develop new models that need less fuel. Therefore, they attempt to present eco-friendly airplanes that might prevent enviroment from being polluted.
In addition, if the amount of travelling by air was reduced, people would likely use other means of transport more. The following increase in the usage of cars, trains and ship will escalate the situation with global pollution, because they are far from being immaculate in terms of ecology too. As a result, the reduce of flights seems to alternate one problem with another which makes a given proposal not ideal.
On the other hand, the discussed suggestion might give positive results if air companies decrease the number of flights by opening more direct destinations. For example, less dangerous fuel would be needed if it was possible to fly directly from Moscow to any New Zealand city without a transfer in South Korea.
To sum up, the problem of air pollution has a plenty of soultions and aspects that should be taken into account. The improvement in technology and logistics seems to be the best ways to provide people with quick and eco-friendly means of transport including airplanes.",7

And finally, I use it sometimes in entertainment purpose. In conclusion, I want to add that there is no the answer for this question: ”What is purpose of social media is right?” I think that we should ask each of people, because each of them have different need and aids.

A great number of people from all over the world dream of having a good, high education in order to get a well paid job. In this case, many people claim that there should be an equal number of students of each sex, both male and female, in Universities in every subject. Personally, I am in two minds about this issue.
On the one hand, without any doubt, it is a good idea for a plenty of reasons. First of all, it will be a perfect boost for developing tolerance in our society. Because, there wouldn’t be jobs only for women and for men. And, so, it will destroy conflicts based on gender. Moreover, it will help our society to develop a lot of male areas, were women can be really usefull. In addition, such a measure can become a great socialisation tool. I firmly believe, that, for instance, on technical faculties, where the majority of students are men, equal number of female can make the study more interesting and productive.
On the other hand, I am totally concerned, that such a situation is impossible. To begin with, I’d like to tell, that male and female has different type of mind. Maybe, that’s why many boys tend to prefer technical subjects and science, while girls preder working with peopleand some not scientific subjests, such as history or sociology. Also, it is not fair at all. Why should we deny some boys or girls in order to make the situation in the university genderly equal? The competition should, and only strongest ones should be able to study in the university, and it isn’t metter is it a man or woman.
All in all, I must confess, that it is a quite complicated topic. But, I also think, that this idea is really unfair. In the tryings to destroy the gender boards, to make everybody equal, to make our society absolutely tolerant, people no longer fallow the human sence. In my firm belief, we must stop it before it is too late.

Besides, there are things that sould be solved as fast as it possible, but there is a question: what is more important to invest in?
From my point of view, space exploration is one of the most significant parts of the country's position in the world. The more you are doing for this field, the more priviledges on the international scene you have. First of all, people tent to look in the future and they try to find a better place to live and raise children. For example, the number one issue in the space science: can we find a planet that has all the conditions human beings need? And scientists have been working on it for many years. What's more, today it is seems that the quantity of strenght and money a country spends on the space shows the real potential of this country.
On the other hand, many people think that the social problems such as poverty or greenhouse effect, for instance, are much more important for the society. Firstly, the space exploration requires enormous amount of money which can be spent on lots of problems. Moreover, problems of space do not have average people's attention. They have other problems to deal with and do not see the advantages of being citizens of the great space country.
However, I think that there are a plenty of ways to cope with this issue. If the government invest not so great sums of money in space, it will have more to give people to solve their problems.
To sum up, I would like to emphasize that there is no right answer to this question: where we should spend money. Everyone has to deside for himself or herself. There are many anvantages and disadvantages from the both points of view.",7

Young people tend to commit more crimes than in previous years. There are different reasons for this tendency. In this essay I will outline some of the causes and provide measures that teachers and parents can take to solve this problem.

According to statistics, nowadays the young are more involved in crimes than ever before. This may happen due to various reasons. To begin with, there are a lot orphans and children living in a street these days. Women and men who are not ready to become parents leave their kids who from this moment have to live on their own. Not knowing what to do and where to go, they join children like them and thay have to steal food and clothes to survive and it becomes normal for them to live such life, life of criminals. What is more, there are families where parents work to much and do not pay enough attention to their children, who eventually make friends with groups of hooligans and marginals. They do not have a good example of the righ behaviour, and that is why they become criminals.

Nevertheless, there are ways to prevent this from happening and solve the problem. First of all, parents should spend more time with their children, they should raise them properly, explaining to kids what is right and what is wrong from the very young age. In addition, parents should control their children's activities and be aware of who their friens are and what they do in their free time. Moreover, not only parents, but also teachers should take part in forming the person, so he or she will not commit crime in the future. Teachers could give lessons devoted to crime and punishment, explaining the consequences of commiting a crime. Finally, they could organise additional classes, which could discover and develope teenages' talents and which would occupy them, so they will not have time for bad activities.
In conclusion, the level of crime commited by youngsters has increased in recent years. There are numerous reasons for this situation, mostly because of lack of parent's control. But it can be solved with the help of parents and teachers, who should provide a good examle to children and show them the right way to life.",7

Local firms and family businesses can not compete with their professional concurents. In this essay I would like to dwell upon the issue that this tendency can lead to equality and high lever of quality in every part of the world.

To start with, there are a lot of countries and towns with absolutely different levels of life. In developing countries people can count only on the fairness of local businesses. So, there are no standarts of their production, they need simply belive that this milk or meat was kept in a right way. On the other hand, in top large businesses this is done for you for sure. Huge number of managers examine all the tecnologies that are used while making a product, so, in each part of the world this product would be the same, would be tested in advansed.

Also, returning to the previous point, you can be sure that you would find the very product you need even in the other continent. When you come to the famous fast food restoraunt, you know in advanced what you can eat and you do not waste your time.

On the other hand, there are those who claim that killing small businesses we kill the culture. This opinion partly has a right to exist. People really do not try to find out something new, they automatically choose the product to which they are used to.

This thought may be valid, but for the economy the concurence is the major starting point. Well, the strongest survives. This provides us with the best products.

To sum up, in my opinion large businesses have better qualities than their smaller collegues. If the business is really strong, it will be popular. The more people work in this sphere for our wealth - the better.",6

One of the most important factors that constitute a future professional 'profile' of every individual is, of course, higher education. Providing society with strictly similar numbers of male and female graduates in each subject would certainly change the labour market as well as academic world. But will these changes be for the better - or for the worse?
The first point to fear in mind is that nowadays students are accepted on the basis of their performance during entrance examinations. That means: only previous qualifications and / or knowledge of each applicant is taken into consideration. Is it fair to give preferences to this or that young person because of their race, religion or gender? No, this will mean discrimination , and that is the inevitable consequence of 'gender-based' intake of students.
Extremely alike reform has been carried out in Germany. The universities are obliged to hold different entrance lists for man and women with different entrance marks. As a result, it may be easier for a male to gain acceptance to a medical school (with 1.3 entrance mark in comparison with female 1.1). I do not think that is 'fairness' in the proper sense of this word.
The only aspiration of this reform I agree with is the feeling that certain fields of science or work are traditionally 'male' or 'female'. Although I don't believe that 'maxing' of sexes should be caused by such a radical method , I think that young girls and boys should be encouraged to take up any profession they are into, no matter if it is supposed to be men- or women-only occupation.

I am absolutely convinced that youth are growing without paying attention to their parents and also teachers. Moreover, children are not getting social and emotional knowledge at their schools. It is one of the main factors to increase crime among youth. Secondly, action movies with murders and robberies are popular amongst youth. It can be clearly seen that these sorts of movies lead to an increase in crime among teenagers as they try to copy what they have seen in the movies.  Furthermore, films have an important influence on young people who are influenced both by what they watch and hear.
To solve this problem a number of actions needs to be made. First of all, parents should know what their children do. Educational talks in a friendly atmosphere will help parents and children to be closer. To my mind, children until they are 18 shouldn`t be allowed to watch action films and games.
Also in schools teachers should know which interests pupils have. The behavior also can say a lot. If they notice children are aggressive and disobedient, they should inform parents.

Many people suggest that this situation many lead to many harmful consequences while other consinsider it as absolutely normal and acceptable. In this essay I will try to analyse this case in terms of its advantages and disadvantages.
To begin with, local small businesses cannot disappear at all. First of all, they are really cosy and it is pleasant for many people to visit such cute places. Furthermore, the link between seller and the client is established and it is vital for many people because they can ask for a piece of advice or recommendation what to buy or whether the good is fresh or not. Aditionally, such local shops can offer us fresh goods which possess better quality.
However, these pluses of local buisnesses can be argued. So, the goods in local shops can be quite expensive and not everyone could afford some kinds of meat or natural dairy products presented there. Futhermore, it is believed that it is not so convenient to buy products in many different places rather than go to supermarket and buy everything that is required at one place. It is well known that nowadays it is possible to buy so many diverse products in supermarkets, from bread to pens and pencils, notebooks for school and even clothes. In such popular supermarket as IKEA people can buy furniture, food and everything that is needed. Additionally, you can have a lunch at the cafe nearby. I assume that for adults with children this option is preferable. Then, it is a special room in the building where the supermarket is located for kids to play and have fun while their parents do shopping. I guess that with our rapid pace of life this variats are convenient and can help save time and energy.

Finally, it is important to look at the highest and the lowest temperatures in both cities. In Yakutsk the temperature hit the peak in the middle of the summer (in July), while in Rio, during January and February, the average highest temperature makes up 30 degrees above zero.
Unlike in the city in Russia, where the lowest temperature is during winter months, about forty degrees below zero, the average temperature in Rio is in July (almost 17 degrees above zero).
Overall, after analyzing the information provided, it can be stated that the average maximum and minimum temperatures in two given cities are completely different. In Yakutsk hot and cold weather change each other rather radically, while there are only slight fluctuations in the average annual temperature in Rio.",7

The only difference is that Blackberry hasn’t gotten no improvements since 2010, and HTC’s share profits level has rosen a bit in 2011. 
Samsung’s level of share profits has climbed from around 15% in 2010 to slightly above 20% in 2013. However, it was its peak. Starting from 2013 Samsungs level has only been plunging till it reached its’ lowest result at the same percentage that Samsung had in 2010.

This essay will fist discuss the reasons for this trend and secondly outline the most important actions that family and teachers can do in case to prevent the future growth of the number of young criminals.

Fistly, we can easily identife the problems in a social sphere of the country by the number of young people who commited a crime. It goes without saying that sometimes the only reason for such illegal actions is poverty. Experiencing a lack of money, suffering from hunger and health problems the person will be trying to improve his or her life, and sometimes it means commiting a crime. The best example is the sutiation in suburb of Moscow, where the young boy, who wanted to eat, stole some money from the old lady. The number of young criminals can not become lower without the support of the social programms.

Secondly, parents and teachers can affect the situation and save young person from performing some danerous actions, as commiting a crime is. Teachers should pay attention to the every child in his or her class in case to recognise the problem in child's lifes and try to solve it with a help of psychologists. Parent should be patien and create a warm athmosphere in a family, because i support the idea, that when your family loves and understands you there is no need to do something illegal to gain money or your popularity among the classmates.

To sum up, i think that the main reason for commiting a crime for young people is lack of money, and to prevent the growth of this trend we should take care of them in families and pay a lot of attention at schools. What is more, some social support from the goverment will be beneficial too.",7

Also an artist' product can expand any dangerous idea that can be harmful for society.


For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that the artist' freedom must be limited by government.

I think, that this strategy can help upgrade economical situation in some countries. But I have one disagreement. As for me, any country must produce the food for import and not in small values, cause it support to nation get more money. Let me talk about it.

Firstly, yeah, it’s very wonderful to produce products that their own population eats. This thing must split all of of countries. It isn’t interesting, when you can eat everything everywhere. All nations will be different. By the way, we can place some markets of cafes with international food, but reduce their own. And countries can reduce spending money on ‘unpopular’ food in current place.

In other way of thinking, countries must not produce the food only for their population. Everyone must produce products for import, cause it so comfortable and cool to get money from other nations, that are interesting in ‘kitchen’ of your homeside. But count of that food must be normal, not little, not huge. That move helps us upgrade economical situation in any country. It help to upgrade life level in some nations in Africa and in south America.

As clearly seen, this statement not so correct, as for me. And I think, that there is kind of interesting idea, but I’ll correct some ‘mistakes’ there. It is so interesting to split countries in that way, but we must know, that import – one huge part of any country and everyone must keep it on mide.

In my opinion, the most prominent reasons for a high crime rate among young people is a lack of sufficient education in school and high inequality between social classes. Nowadays school provide not enough educational materials and lectures related to the topic of crime. Students do not acknowledge how dangerous their inappropriate actions might be for society and for themselves. As an example, we can observe increased cases of shooting at schools and colleges. Another significant cause of crimes committed by young people is increasing inequality in society. Young people from the lower classes of society are not satisfied with this state of affairs, which drags them to committing more robberies and thefts. Take a student who lacks money for his education and living. The only way for him to get money is to violate the law because he cannot find an appropriate job.
Considering the causes of high crime rate among young people, schools and parents should provide more education to young people. Teacher and parents should speak more about the danger of becoming a criminal and suggest that young people can achieve success without being perpetrators.
Taking into account all above-mentioned factors, it is obvious that high amount of young criminals constitutes a serious problem with deep causes. It is to be hoped that educational methods would help in combating this social illness.

Even more dangerous is the alarming tendency of rising youth crime cases. This might stand for growing anxiety in the society and law’s - respect by non-adults. As possible effects of this trend I can mention social unstability and lack of intellegent human resourses in future. Though there are people, who should guide their children and in order to prevent catastrophic damages to the humanity in terms of dangerous coming generations.
To eliminate the problem and stop this unhealthy crime wave, we must find out reasons for it. In my opinion there are two main causes: historical and psychological. A century ago, people of my age have been working full time for 5 years. The usage of children’s hands in manufacturing, farms had been widely spread unlike education and equal rights: prosperious families could afford to send their kids to schools while carpenter’s children began to work from very young age. Nowadays the situation has changed and young people do not have to earn money since they are physically ready to. Thus, more freedom resulted in less control and young people began to use their time for commiting crimes also. Being supported by families and sometimes by the government, kids feel protected and might look for some interesting activities besides school, which is a psychological reason for them to do something illegal.
Crime is an action of disobeyment and representation of person’s disagreement with given rules or his life circumstances. In teenager’s souls rebelious thoughts are growing. If not carefully guided, their flame and energy will go away and burn everything down. So, parents and teachers as main advisors should take care of young people. They must create a comfortable environment and atmosphere of love to make them feel good. Relationships in family are the most important thing determing young’s beheviour in future, so parents shoud behave respectfully to their child thoughs and personality as well as teachers.
To conclude, young crimes are upsurging, which is a problem leading to serious negative effects on the society. Because of freedom spreading teenagers began to feel allmighty and do everything they want.

Each election they appeal to their electorate's pre-existing opinions to manipulate them into voting for ""the good guys"". In this particular case, the opinion seems to be that it's all the young'uns fault, and that back in the day things were different.

That premise is partially true, of course. Young people do commit more crimes than the mature and elderly. The reason for that is younger people are generally less experienced, and it's perfectly natural for them to drink and drive, act before they think, or to simply succumb to their natural violent urges. Hardcore criminals either get weeded out by natural selection, give up, or get smart and don't get caught anymore. This is how it's been for hundreds of years, this is how it is now, and this is how it'll remain, unless Earth becomes a planet-wide police state.

Parents and teachers are less help to the already-damaged people than they think. Empirical evidence suggests that parents are generally lousy guardians that don't have the first idea about raising a wholesome individual, and teachers are desperate incompetent nags that further distance the youth from self-improvement and healthy self-actualization. The most important thing for parents to do would be to not procreate until they know what to do with their offspring. The teachers can also rethink their career choices unless they are decent people.

War is dominating in these state and this is the cause of that businessmen leave these countries and people lose their jobs.
Secondly, I would like to notice that Southern Asia has a very low level of unemployment. This is the cause of high level of post injustfisation which creates exrenent conditions for business thanks to which the level of unemployment was steadily going down in the previous years.
In addition, I would like to observe some rapid changes in the EU, Latin America and Middle East: 1) European Union has a big migrant income which to that fact that migrants get jobs and it creates a gap for europeans which increases the level of unemployment. Peasants from Syria left Middle East for Europe which made a plummet for them. 3) Latin America is having a big increase in GDP., reaching new peast and creating working seats they decrease the unemployment.

First of all, someone's decision to watch a film or not is usually based on their expectations of the film's quality. For example, if a person wants to watch a science fiction or fantastic film, he or she wants to see there special effects of high quality, and it is reasonable to think that they would be much better in a Holliwood film with a big budget.
Secondly, people's desire to watch some film often depends on its publicity. Local film companies often do not have enough money to widely advertise their product, so public may not even be informed well enough about the film and would prefer to spend money on watching a Holliwood blockbuster with famous actors instead of some independent film.
Some people believe that governments should invest money in local film companies in order to change this situation. I do not agree with this point of view. In my opinion, film production does not differ from any other commercial industry. Therefore, the ability to find investors is a part of this business. In addition, there is a danger that government would invest only in the films with 'proper' plots, which means that they will control directors' freedom of speech.
To sum up, there are many reasons for people to choose foreign films and not local ones. While some people argue that it is a worrying trend which must be changed through governments policy, it is actually a normal situation in modern world of commerce.",7

In this essay I will try to explain the reasons for the enchancement of offence rate and offer some solutions.
To begin with, I sould say that in most countries some youngsters can't find a good job.
In some deprieved countries the government is not able to generate job places for residents and when people can't find any duty to do they try to get money by other ways such as crime. They shoould keep their family with all the essentials and urgent things but they don't have money for that.
Thereby, people and especially the young try to make a fortune with illegal things like drug abuse or burglary and offences.

What is more, the teenagers are too prone to commit a crime because of their friends who may inffluence on them.
Furthemore, some teens don't last their education due to some problems such as family issues. Instead of being at schoold they wander during the day in streets with their peers and when they do not have money to buy what they want , teens think about robbery or other staling offences.
These all facts lead to commiting a crime.


There are possible solutions to tackle with this problem.The government and parents should do accurate thing for youngsters. The government has to create job places where young people can do something to earn money. In terms of parent's duty they must be friend of their children and assist their kids to solve their problmes and always stand by them. At schools teachers also should try to help students when it comes to different issues.

To sum everything up I should say that lack of social and educational knowledge are one of the main factos which can increase crime among young children and everything is in the hands of parents,teachers and government as well.",7

The prominent feature of the data appears to be it's diversification: we are shown not only bare figures of amount of users but also reasons for accesing the social network.

Just by a quick look at the vertical bar chart we can grasp two features in terms of amount of Facebook users.
Firstly we are to admit that there is a significant rise in the percentage of users accesing the social network from mobile devices. In March 2013 amount of such users rose roughly twice as much comparing to the same period of the year 2012. Speaking about another feature of this chart, the total number of Facebook users increased by the year 2013 but actually not so substantially as it was with the amount of mobile device users.

Moving next to another chart -- describing general reasons for using Facebooks -- it is worth noticing that situation describe varies a little bit from the previous chart. Here no such strict conclusions can be made instantly. However, a more detailed look at the chart provides us with the information the the most popular reason for accesing Facebook appeared to be sharing photos and videos. Evenmore this mean also showed the highest growth of it's rate gaining 15% in it's popularity. Interestingly, how all the participants -- all the reasons -- didint show any decrease overall. In contrast to most of the participants, Receiving updates remained the same throughout the period given at the level of 39%. Other reasons for accesing Facebook which are Seeing funny posts and Recieving updates maintained moderate rate of growth by nearly 10%.

Thus, by examining charts given we can conclude that overall popularity of Facebook between years 2012 and 2013 definitely increased by any means. The social net gained a substrantial amount of mobile device users and also we've seen that there were also risings of different intensities by any resons for accesing Facebook. The only exception was shown by Recieving updates mean but still it didnt show any decrease remaining at the same level as it would be in the year of 2012.",7

There is no doubt that in some cases the widespread use of modern technology may cause health problems. The most obvious situation that can prove this thesis is eye deseases. Nowadays the majority of people has some problems with their eyes because of the use of gadgets. They cannot live without their mobile phones and laptops and never leave these gadgets alone. For the same reason people may have headaches. What is more, people  nov have a tendency to spend their free time on home laying on the sofa and watching a TV or playing computer games. Thus, they don’t go for a walk and don’t do any sport activity, they only become fat.

Moreover, technology has a goof aspects too, if people would use it correctly. Moreover these problems will be reduced. For instance, people should prefer long walks to using their gadjets. They should be active in their lives. In addition, they must understand the importance of time limit of using their gadjets. What is more parents should teach their children to spend their spare time with friends or relatives. Going to picnics or going to a little trip can save all this negative situation.

Tu sum up, using of technology nay cause a negative effects, but people can reduce it and find a perfect solution for this problem.

It is actually in cities, because city is uncial place for living, it is antonym for ‘wild routine’. Cities has their own weather and climat, it is first cause of problems, like cold feats, but it is not general. There is more massive problems, like transport or factories.

Firstly, I talk about transport. It call 2 types of problems: contemporary problems with health from transport is, for example, if you are hit by car and now your arm is broken. Long-lasting problem from transport is gases in air, gases from engines, can’t name a problem but I know then breathing by period wastes is not so helpful for your body. We can solve that problems, if we use electro-engines or something like that. Secondly, big problem is factories, of course.

For example, factory put wastes to nearly lake, fish in lake eat wastes and became not so good for eating, but we don’t know it, and that fish was killed and served to our kitchen table, and after that we had stomach problems.

Well, modern technology society causes a lot of troubles to routine, and sometimes we forget that we are nature, and we make problems for ourselves. Mankind makes troubles to mankind, and we must control this situation.

Along with this trend huge corporations are coming to the arena, offering high-quality (or not) products and professional customer service devouring small local businesses. In this essay I want to discuss the pros and cons of this problem.
Firstly, the domination of a brand increases the chance of monopolization, which is damaging for the economy of the country and for the customers. The corporation gets the power to dictate the rules of the market such as lowest price range for the product and making the situation worse for the other producers.
Secondly, thriving corporations give us less freedom as the consumers. The root of the problem is the decrease of the opportunities for small businesses. The less the competitivenes among businesses the less benefits for the customers. It is widely known that this process is the engine of the economy.
On the other hand, multinational brands provide us with a convenient service, considering it was all done by professionals, maximum comfort and unforgettable shopping experience. That is why the most of us opt for Wallmart as a weekly shopping place. It is more reliable and fast.
Overall, I can say that disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Corporations hurt the national economy and taking our customer freedom. This issues should be tackled by the governments with special legislations to decrease their power.",7

There are a couple of other methods that should be implemented to reduce air pollution to which travelling in planes contributes a lot. At first, it is essential to define which journays can be considered not so necessary and which ones cannot be canceled. Of course, all people belive that their journey is important, but cannot they take it going by bus or by train?
Needless to say that it is much slower and less convenient, but governments should encourage such conscious changes of planes and, for instance, provide cheaper tickets for those who decided not to fly but to drive.
Other possible solution is to reduce the number of personal planes and helicopters of movie, football stars and other famous persons. Because quite offten they use it just for one's pleasure and without any real aim.
Moreover, this problem can also be tackled with cancelling those programm of additional free miles that are given to those people who fly a lot. It will not encourage people to travel by planes but by public transport or by trains.

Such people are pirats and I’m fully agree with the point of view that the pirats should be punished.
First of all, the musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies. That’s why the quality of music and films is decreasing. Because the artists don’t get one full amount of money, they couldn’t use it to make better music or films, they don’t have any evidences that their next work wouldn’t be downloaded from the Internet for free.
Secondly, it’s obviously, that every work should be paid off. For example, we pay for the food in the supermarket or for the any other material thing. But it’s hard to pay for something that you can’t feel in your hand. But, as for me, there is the same logic and people don’t download the film, for example, they steal it, like they can steal a fruit in the supermarket.
Thirdly, when we buy an illegal copy of the product, we don’t get the full emotions, because of such copies have the bad quality, not so beautiful print, for example, and many other things. Moreover, I think, that buying one pirate copy of the music or film we don’t make a special connection between the artist and the consumer.
And last, but not least, is that the illegal pirate copies aren’t good for the economy of the countries. Buying the legal copy, you pay a special fee, which can be used, for example, for the social systems of the country. Stealing the music you make bad things for the artists, but for the other citizens of the country too.

The essay will discuss firstly, the problems that are connected with health, and, secondly, the solutions which can decide these problems
To begin with, the most significant problem connected with the use of technology is hat the ultraviolette destroys the humans' immune system. For example, if a person is sitting with the computer for the whole day and playing some games, or sitting on the Internet, then he/she will have a headache, the vision will be much worse. Moreover, there is a problem with radiation. For example, the phones which people use or the electronic resources, where they bake can also bring a harm on health. The radiation can increase the number of such deases as cancer.
To reduce such problems the scietists and innovators should get them into the account. Firstly, they should produce such technologies that will have much less raiation, that will not be so harmful for people's health. Secondly, they have to get in an account that people spend a lot of time with these technologies, for example, phone. Thirdly, people should put some rules in using such technologies theirselves, because nobody will follow for them and that technologies they use. And finally, the government have to put some patents on the most harmful technologies.
To conclude, there are a lot of technologies that harm people's health, but this problem can be reduced.

 On the other hand, copying and sharing music of films on the internet makes it more popular and famous. Moreover, autors of music and film can became really good and famous person.

I agree that air transport creates negative effects that can do a lot harm to Earth but all kinds of industry damage ecology (for example, chemical industry, atomic factories).Government can not reduce activities of all industries (in this case people need to produce less goods with such results like famine and lack of goods). To control only air travel is pointless without influence on other dangerous industries because ecology will suffered anymore.
Moreover air travel is more fast then train travel. The plains save human resources (time is great value nowadays). People need to spent 7 days to reach Vladivostok from Moscow. It is enormous costs of time and the conditions in Russian trains are definitely uncomfortable. People suffer if they need to spent some days in trains.

In my essay I am going to examine this question from both points of view. On the one hand there are those who argue that the best way to reduce crime is to make prison sentences longer. The main reason for believing this is the fact that longer sentences will make criminals think more and hesitate more while having in intention to commit a crime. It is also worth pointing that the violent and mentally ill people will be isolated from the society for a longer period and this increases safety of the civilians. On the other hand, there are people who think that the humanity should search for alternative ways to make the crime level decrease. They think so because not letting the crimes happen is a better and an easier way to reduce crime. It is more efficient to create a better social environment, and try to fight against social unsatisfaction, which leads to the main part of the crimes, than to punish criminals with longer prison sentences. I can add that it is scientifically proved that severe punishments such as really long sentences or death do not reduce the crime levels. Also, there is always a risk of the judgement mistake and the person who is not guilty will suffer from it. As we can see, there are no simple answers to this question. In balance, however, I tend to believe that alternative ways to solve this problem are better, because it seems to me more efficient not to let the crime happen, then to make the punishment more severe.",7

This thend seems to have its own advantages, but at the same time it has its drawbacks. In the following essay they both will be considered compared with. On the one hand, the such a development appeares to bring significant benefits both to the countries where buisnesses are moved and to the companies that act in this way. For companies it is good, firstly, because in developing countries there are no as many rivals as in developed ones; therefore, these international companies can almost totaly occupy corresponding spheres, market sectors, etc. Secondly, local employees in developed countries require significantly bigger salaries; consequently, the companies moving their businesses to developing countries can spent less money on workers. As for local habitants, they have more opportunities to find job and can be sure of the quality of production they get from these companies.  However, in such a development there are several disadvantages. Maybe the main of them, for instanse, is that occuping spheres of their buisnesses they hardly leave a chance for local developers to run their own buisnesses. As a consequence of that predominance of international companies, it can be argued that because of monopolies which are established in this way it becomes difficult to control quality, prices, etc. All in all, it can be said that the disadvantages noted in the essay although being unpleasant in some ways do not outweigh the advantages, for a developing country receiving an international company gains experience and approaches to the level of devepoled countries. Therefore, if sometime in the future it decides to develop its own businesses, it will have enough money, educated people and other resources to do that.",7

That is why goverments should decrease amount of air travel for several things: for having a rest or for business trips for example.
On the one hand, I agree that air travel have a lot of disadvantages. For instance, we should care about our native planet and not to allow to damage the Earth. Air travel is the reason for huge ecological problems. For example, air become really dirty and water is not an exception. We should remember, that resources can end. To add to this, global warming in the increasing stage. I am sure plans destroy atmosphere by their waste.
But on the other hand, air travel have several drawbacks, which can not be admitted. Air travel is a great opportunity to see the whole world and to know the wonderful secrets of each corner of our planet. Furthermore, from my point of view air travel is vital for people, who want see beautiful sights and learn traditions, customs and history of other countries. Also, I believe, that travel by plan is the most convinient and comfortable type of transport. I think, that air travel economy your time. In my opinion, air travel helps people to develop business, because other countries it is a new people, new views and new connections, which are necessary for flouiishing of business.
To sum up, I want to underline, that people can not abandon plans, because of their advantages, but we should not forget about the Earth and the environment. To my mind, we should use air travel if only we have very important reason for it.

Some people believe that air carries are responsible for air pollution more than car owners and factories and governments should take measures to reduce their harm to the atmosphere. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion.

First of all, there is a huge demand in air travels. There are a lot of aims air carries can help to reach from private needs like desire of holidays or want to visit relatives to delievery of goods from another part of the world. Obviously, it is impossible to decrease the number of air travels.

Moreover, greater contribution to air pollution and global warming lies in car owners and factories hands. Every day people themselves destroy atmosphere using private transport instead of public. It should be noticed that in modern world a lot of families have two and more cars for each family member. Therefore, there is a huge air polluting effect produced by ouselves. What is more, there is no need to discuss about responsibility of factories for damaging atmosphere.

In addition, there are not so many rich people in the World who can afford using their own flights. Thus, I cannot agree that a lot of air travel is unnecessary as private flights are only one of some hundreds of public ones.

In conclusion, there are some other spheres to control by governments but air travels. Everyday human's actions can make a greater input in destroying atmosphere and causing global warming. Therefore, governments should focus on creating laws to control people's usage of private transport and factories' pullings in rivers and air instead of reducing the amount of air travels used.

It is difficult for everyone to imagine the sky with no plane, to go on a long trips and voyages only by train and car as these vehicles seem us too slowly now. Despite air transport is really useful, it produces poisonous emissions in the air and contributes to global warming.
To my mind, it would be great if our government create some laws to reduce air pollutions. It is obvious that the problem of pollution is connected with an enormous amount of different kinds of transport. Actually, this issue is caused not only by air transport. In such cities like Moscow the biggest part of these emissions is produced by private and public transport that everyone use everyday. Cars, taxis and some buses damage our atmosphere much more stronger than planes and helicopters. It is quite complicated for government to introduce a law which can safe our air from pollutions and maintane an atmosphere clean. For instance, nowadays there is a quick development of vehicles that work from electricity or from alternative energy resources, but not everyone will change their own comfortable transport on such electricity cars as they are quite expensive and difficult to charge (in Moscow there is no special stations for charging electric transport).
However, it is thought that air travels are more harmful due to huge sizes of engines of air transport. Planes or helicopters need much more petrol than those vehicles we use on the ground. Consequently, they through out a lot of emissions in our atmosphere, more than public and private transport. This opinion is quite faire.
Overall,I believe that our governments should not concentrate only on changing out transport, but also on the people's upbringing. Probably if we start to tell children about serious problems of ecology, of air pollution and global warming, we could influence their minds and make them to carry our atmosphere. May be in 20 years we all start to use bicyles instead of cars and taxis, or we will try to get our destinations on foot, not by buses.

Instagram is most rarely used by the people of age, with only 6 percent of people over 65 years old having an Instagram account.

LinkedIn, on the other hand, is most popular among people from 30 to 64 years old. The number of users of the youngest and the oldest age groups are equal - 22 percent. This can be explained by the different needs of each generation, with LinkedIn being more of a business social network, unlike Facebook or Instagram, which are used mostly for socializing and entertainment.

For example, government look for killers and does not give them the chance to kill anyone. Another way why longer prison sentences is good is that many prisons give these people opportunity to help society while the are there. For instance, law breakers can clean streets, make clothes or cook. So, rising of prison sentence means that they will help us longer and with this they can return something for their bad things. On the other hand, if people have not done anything illegal but they have been charged by mistakes for someone, they will have to stay longer inside the prison because of the increasing sentences. In my opinion, we have to increase prison sentences, so peopled will pay for killing people or other illegal things that they have done. And thaks to that people will afraid to break the law because they will fear to waste so many time in prison.

Actually, there is a number of reasons for this issue. First  and foremost, it is clearly, that every single person living in a modern realities has his or her own smartphone. Nowadays scientists strongly believe that mobile phones can make a huge damage to human’s heath-rhythm and eyesight. Secondly, logisty say that a permanent opportunity to get any kind of information you want causes many problems. For example with nerves and human’s phsychology in general. Another major reason is the fact that the level of traffic in modern cities is highly increased. This causes air pollution, which is also destroying for human’s health. Some researches say that nowadays ozone layer is already damaged so much, that we can’t even recover it. 

Nevertheless, there are some ways humanity could use to resolve these issues. Firstly, we can rearrange transporting use as more environmentally-friendly. For example, international transportations could make their transporting by using electric transport. Trains nowadays are as fast as cars or ships. This kind of transport is not wedespreaded because of the borders and the laws. I guess, governments should think about ecology and open borders for the international railway connection. Another thing that can be done to reduce technology damage on our health is try to face less mobile phone or a computer in your everyday life. You might use your phone only for connecting people and a compute only for work issues, for instance.

To summarise, I would like to say that influence of widespread technology on our health is not just technologies imperfectane fault. Personally, I think that it is our own choise. To ger pleasure and comfort by using our gadgets and have some problems with health or to have a great healthy body, but say ‘no’ to using technologies for your pleasure.

I do not agree with this statement and and I would like to express my opinion.

The first obvious reason to tend to import more foreign food is the better meal variety of citizens. This factor can lead to better productivity and happiness of average citizen. Moreover most people are open-minded about trying something new in their life and food is no exception. With high posibility this desition, which was stated before, will be supported by anyone. the second reason about importing more food comes from the medical point of view. There is a high posibility that local food does not contain enough minerals and nutrients to supply the body. This may result in problems with health, which lead to higher chance to get ill, reduction of average lifespan and so forth. This is why it is so important to have a wide variety of food available in all supermarkets. Last, but not least argument is that reducing the amount of import will significantly harm the economy. it is clear that this trade between countries would have only positive impact on both countries which participate in it. The foreign seller which perhaps has high supply of his national food, is able to balance it by selling it our country. Our country also has sort of income because buying food from other countries is probably cheaper to produce it by yourself. Thus it is a win-win situation.

Summing up, I would like to mention that lowing production of local food and increasing import of it will no doubt have a positive impact on every single attribute of modern life and can also improve the economy.

This essay suggests the ideas what could cause that social phenomena, and it also gives advice to parents and teachers on the matter what can help the situation.

As far as I can see, the world where we live now is more complicated that it was years ago, and that is the main reason and the cause. As I know it from my personal experience, once a child becomes a young adult they get scared of the tons of opportunities and responsability they now have. The fear a young man has may lead to panic and misunderstanding what they should do with their life. Therefore, the lack of understanding of the society they live in forces them to make mistakes and as far as the situation deteriorates a person is likely to get influenced by the wrong people. What is more, as soon as a newly-born criminal realises and admits their sins they are already scared of the punishment and harassment they may get. So, even having realised the situtaion, they continue living the way they have been living for a good while. Thus, the main causes of that socail phenomena are complexity of the world we live in and young people's misunderstanding of the modern society.

Even though it seems to be a global problem that may need a profound approach to solve it, I think it is possible to prevent young people from comitting crimes and even help those who are already considered criminals. The lead should be taken by people who are responsable for children's socialisation: parents and teachers. Both of them should make kids understand that even if they make a mistake they are welcome to rehabilitate and nothing bad will happen to them. Moreover, teachers at school should tell students about how the world live and interact for them not to be scared of the diversity of laws, cultures, ways to live and to work. In addition, young people should be aware of different kinds of institutions existing to help them if they get in trouble.
To draw a conclusion I want to say that there are more methods that could be applied to help the problem. One method may fail in one society, while it may succeed in the other one. Each young criminal has a story to tell, thus, an individul approach may be needed.",7

There are great number of Apple’s profits at the last year – more than 90 percents. Blackberry was stable falling last 5 years – from 20 percents to 5. There is the same situation with HTC’s number, except 2011 year, when it grew from 10 to 5 percents. After the key year Samsung’s number was greatfully falling from their biggest percentage to about 15 percents. At the last 2 years Apple was growing up for more than 30 percents.

Also, manufactured goods both transported by rail (25%) and by road (28%).

However, machinery transported by rail really more then by road (by rail is 12%, by road is 2%). It is cleary seen, that goods like chemicals and non-metallic minerals has middle percentage of popular transported by road and by rail. For instance, chemicals consists 11% by rail and 16% by road, and non-metallic minerals has 11% by rail and 13% by road.

On the contrary, Instagram and LinkedIn are not as widely used. While slightly more than a half of the younger generation have an Instagram account, only a quarter of people aged from 30 to 49 communicate via this network. As for those who are 50 years old or more, Instagram users make up a small minority.

So I agree that government should control the amount of air travel. Firstly, I think that we need to protect Earth from ourselves, new laws about air travel can be first step. We use gas and oil for planes, also we use ferrum for engeenering. This is very harmful for planet. Also because of planes influence on atmosphere, level of air pollution and global warming rise in future. Furthermore, to my mind, these new laws can be oportunity for science. They can develop some kind of new transport type or try not to use natural gas or oil but use trash or waist. Nowadays we can read about dzones. We can’t travel with help of them. But if we talk about mail or global shop delivery where dzones can be more effective than planes. For example last year big internet shop Amazon use dzones for delivery. They did it for advertising but why we can’t do this in our lives too? Also we can’t forget about our health. Air travel is not very helpful. Some doctors say that you will influenced by some radiation then you are in the sky. Pregnant women are not allowed to travel by plane, is not this a point of harmful influence? On the other hand we can’t forget about human rights. We can travel, can have business in different country, can visit relatives. And government can’t cancel all air travel and close the gates. To conclude, I would like to say that we need to be careful for our planet, our health. And population need to find golden line where our rights and our duties have the same level of importance.

It is discussed whether it is suitable to decrease the number of flights to stop the devastating impact of air travel on our planet. Surely, with development of high-speed ground travel, such as faster trains like ICE, the need for aviation slowly disappears in most developed countries high-speed train networks offer the same routes, but trains are cheaper, more ecological, more comfortable and sometimes even faster: in most cities rail terminals are situated in the center, while the airports are usually located far in suburbs. The second disadvantage of an aeroplane is comfort and security: passengers are suited in far more narrow space, which deprives of personal comfort and makes survival case of emergency more complicated, which is an actual problem, taking in account the increase in number of plane crashes and terrorist attacks.
However, there are arguments for opposite point of view. The main is a fact that airplane is still the fastest way of travelling to high-distance and remote destinations: no train can move a person from New York to Moscow in ten hours. It is especally important for countries like Russia, where the space exceeds imagination, but development of ground transport is still far from satisfactory. In the same time, building railway networks is highly expensive because of climate, so aviation is the only suitable mean of transport.
In conclusion I'd like to say I moderately agree with the statement, but taking in account country we're speaking about. In Europe in land flight ban seems acceptable but in Russia with its vast spares it is impossible.

I suppose that artists should be able to create whatever they want. Nevertheless there have to be some restrictions related to showing it publicly.
First of all, some artists don't have any boundaries and a lot of people love their works. However, these pieces of art can be harmful for children, because they are very sensitive and they percept everything they see. That's why it's reasonable to prohibit children to watch some films, visit some exhibitions and listen to some pieces of music.
Secondly, I have mentioned earlier that these restrictions should not be too serious. It means that artists should have their right to create anything they want. If a child gets access to prohibited pieces of art it's not the fault of an artist.
Also I believe that the grown-ups are able to decide themselves whether to read a book or not, whether to go to an exhibition or not. Even if they are shocked by the way an artist expresses himself they can deal with it. That's why the adults shouldn't not be restricted from getting acquomted with this or that piece of art. The only limit has to be the dignity of other people. I think that it concerns some kinds of installations.
All in all, it seems to me that people are free to express themselves. On the other hand, they need to remember that they are not the only ones who will see their creations. The restrictions are to focus on protection of children and dignity of other people and not on some political matters. These restrictions should not be similar to censorship.

At first, the air transport is the one of the popular, safety and fast king of transport. Nowadays, humanity can not to find appropriate substitution for it. For instance, it is impossible to remove on anather materic without air, if between couple of places are ocean.

It is mostly connected with the increasing importance of the Internet for people. In my opinion, punishing people for doing such crimes should be cancelled, because of the context of new market, which changes under the pressure of the Internet.
First of all, it is important to understand that you cannot control all of the information in the web networks. There are many people, who copy and share content of electronic information illegally, but catching and punishing all of them will be really expensive. The cost of this may be probably higher than the loss of money from the process of “pirating”.
Secondly, modern market moves in the direction of micro transactions, instead of simple selling the product. You can get more money from consumer, who has free access to some fragments of your film, but pays for the other fragments. However, this strategy can also be violated by pirates, because they can make copies of expensive fragments. Besides, statistics shows that this method of fighting with pirates is more effective than punishing them.
Last but not least, punishing pirates leads to the violation of the right for the freedom in the Internet. By monitoring and controlling cases of illegal copying of the information, companies will interrupt private life of people and their opportunity to be free in the web.
Taking everything into consideration, my disagreement with the punishing of the people, who copying and sharing music or films illegally, can be explained by the influence of the Internet on the modern market system. law should be appropriate to the instantly changing reality and deal with pirates as with the common element of modern world.

Some people think that the athlets who use illegal drugs shouldn't participate in competion during some period of time, the opponents insists that using of drugs should be punished more radically, so the athlets should be banned forever.
On the other hand, the first idea is based on humanity. Everyone can make a mistake even an athlet. But it seems that this measure will work only if the sportsmen really appologise for his action. If he do not he will use drugs in future more carafully and we have a negative influence on a copetition.
That is why for the another hand, the eternal ban will be better. It will protect all pure athlets. Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages in this method, because it do not include the mistake of RUADA or other antidopping organisations. And not even the career of a good athlet can be ruin after such mistakes, but also the sport in country where he came from.

Personally I disagree with that claim and I hold the opinion that punishment is not an effective solution to the named problem.
Undoubtely, there are some reasons for punishing people who do not pay for the content. To begin with, musicians and producers lose money they deserved and it leads to lack of motivation to create new films and music tracks. Additionally, money payed for art producers are investments in future projects. Finally, losing such amounts of money hurts not only creators, but also the government budget which has its own profit from the taxes.
Nevertheless, punishing for copying and sharing music and videos seems to be bad idea. Firstly, free products of art provides cultural development of the population. It is irrational and even unfair to punish those who are aimed at self-development but do not have money for it. This person can be a child, a student or just somebody with financial problems. Secondly, people who are able to pay will pay if they adore the content and they want to say some thanks to those who created it. Thirdly, the Internet is the informational field which is difficult to control by the law, so punishing will be technically difficult to implement.
To sum up, punishing for sharing and copying objects of art can satisfy those who produce them, but also can influence on cultural development in negative way.

First of all, they argument that every work must have the salary, and the biggest part of tists salary is the sum of money that they gained when someone buying his product. Logically, that if nobody wouldn’t to buy the original because he prefer to download the film or music for free, then artists will haven’t motivation to create more, because his work can’t give them a money. As a result, the industry of art to losing not only a money, but what more important, a talents who want to do genius creation and gain money for that.
Also, other part exist too. Some peoples sures, that the punishment for sharing music or films for free is terrible idea! Firstly, they argue, that art should be free because everyone must have an access for all creations of art, for have more possibilities to developp. but not all peoples can buy every song, for example, that pretty for him, it’s too expensive, and this man or woman may haven’t a money for that. Secondly, when someone would to buy something, it necessary to know the quality of this creation and often peoples haven’t some possibility to check it. For example, a music. One can’t understand is it satisfy one’s needs while hearing, but it impossible to hear it when buying. When pirates exists it possible to find concret song in Internet and heare before buying and then one know is it necessary to buy it. The same situation with films. Trailer of film can’t give the information about real quality of product, and when someone can watch the part of film in Internet, then he or she will go to the cinema to watch it in the high denition, or buy blue-ray disk.

According to the graph, the demand for electricity in winter and summer differs. For instance, daily demand for units of electricity in a cold season is more that two times bigger between 9 and 21 hours. All the same time, there is a common trend. It is clear from the graph that using electricity reaches the peak in 22 hours and reaches the lowest point in 7-8 hours A.M. The difference that is connected with seasons, can be explained with the help of the pie chart. As we can see, More than half of total using the electricity is connected with heating water or rooms, but in summer such actions are not very actual, as a result, the total demand decreases. However, watching TV or using electric tools have no correlation with weather have with hours.
To sum up, the demand for electricity in England is various in winter or summer and in different hours. There are temporary criteria, such as heating water or rooms, that reflect the total number of units according to the season and permament that are connected with daily demand.

This essay firstly will discuss the main cause of the health problems, secondly the essay will offer some solutions. 

First of all, the cause of the great number of health problems is not the technology, but  overusing technology in life. Before widespread of televisions and phones people preferred to meet each other, to walk in parks, o spend time with family, playing sport games, or even to camp. Nowadays more and more individuals spend their free time behind TV or computer. For example, it can be noticed that children like to play videogames in modern life, may be even more than play with each other in football, basketball and other activities. 

Nevertheless, some solution to the problem are exist. The government can provide social programs to stimulate people to do sport, it can predict them from health problems. For example, they can create different  programs with sport activity in parks, people will interest something new and if they will spend more time on thresh air, it will be a good point for their health. The government can also provide help for some groups, for instance, to buy card to gym with sales. 

To conclude, the main cause of majority of diseases in present is the widespread use of modern  technology. People forget about activities, sport and benefit of fresh air and spend a lot of time on the sofa behind the TV and computers. Government should stimulate people to do sport, providing social programs and help.

Further in my essay I would like to speak about various possible reasons for this upward trend and who and how can deal with this problem.

Firstly, there is a huge amount of adverse servers and advertisement nowadays.Therefore, any child wants to be the 'the coolest' person in the class, he or she desired of having great power and everybody dreams of beying looked up to. Usually, all this can be reached only by fierce actions. For instance, the boy who is fourteen meets the young rap band and he wants to be one of them, but those boys could only just laugh at him and force to do unpleasant things.
Moreover, another important cause of engaging in crime could be the lack of money. There is such an enormous number of products that a toung person could have wanted. Every expensive thing is observed and studied by a youngman from every side, and it is vituallu necessaru for him or she to get it. This situation can lead to completely awful consequences, for example, shoplifting, shooting or even murder.
Talking about the solutions, the first thing that has come to my mind is the parent-child relashionships and parents control, you should spend as much time with your child in his or her childhood as you can, at least simply giving advice what is wrong and what is right. In addition, I believe that special cources at school would greatly help pupils. In my view, every teacher should think about it and maybe prepare a short speech on different topics in crime and the health of every student.

Overall, there are numerous reasons for crime development between young persons, however, there are not less ways to combat I would strongly recommend every adult person to be aware of your children's hobbies or friend, try to protect them with the help of teachers or doctors - do everything what is needed for your child to be safe.",7

Some people argue that Facebook, Vkontakte, etc. should contribute to the further sharing of information and knowledge. The others see the main function of such networks in entertainment. In this essay I will consider both points of view. Turning to the first opinion, it should be mentioned if social media keep on developing in the direction of sharing knowledge, it will contribute to worldwide improvements in technologies and prosperity. Information is a factor of an utmost significance today, and knowing the latest developments in other countries is very important in all spheres of life. For instance, shifts in consumer preferencies may be observed from social networks, therefor leading some businesses to changes. Such an approach can be a little bit misleading as the information in such a medium can be misinterpreted as it is not always written in a literally way. Talking about the other point of view, entertainment has become an essential part of our everyday life. I mean, that with a lot of stress all around us there should be left some room for leisure. And in that way social networks help to get rid of the unbearable part of the reality. However, such trate of thinking can lead to more people being considered as social outcast as they do not participate in real life, indeed being absorbed in their devices constantly scrolling web-pages. It also can have a detrimental impact on any economy.  To conclude, two ways of thinking on the purpose of social media considered there are both prons and cons in each approach. Personally, I think that we should not put functions under question apart as both information and entertainment are important and can exist at one and the same time.

There are a considerable number of ways to reduce crime level and make our lives safer, and they are often discussed. Some people suggest to make prisons sentences longer, while others see other opportunities to solve the problem. It seems to be clear why someone believes that longer inprisonments can be helpful in reducing crime. Firstly, it may influence criminals' mind: if they see the perspective to loose their freedom foe a significant number of years in prison, some of them will probably choose not to commit a crime. However, it seems to me that this way a mortal punishment will be a more effective way. Secondly, there is a popular point of view that years in prison can change a person considerably. During this long period of time he or she can sincerely regret about the deed and change the behaviour, but it is clear that, unfortunately, it does not happen with every criminal. Speaking about alternative methods of reducing crime, improving security system or, for instance, work with teenagers from poor families can be stated. Installing more video cameras in the streets and public places, developing new ways of cyber safety and constant training of policemen and other security staff might help to solve the problem. But it seems to me that it is more important to work with potential criminals and victims, not with the circumstances or consequences of a crime. It is a common knowledge that the possibility of commiting a crime is higher among people with criminal routes, uneducated and with the low living standards. A person, who has seen illegal way of living in the childhood, has more risks to commit a crime by himself. Therefore, it may be a good idea to pay more attention to needs of such people and, for example, provide more psychological work with their children. Speaking about crimes with ""normal"" children is not less important. Everyone should know the basic ways of self-defence in different situation and probably even be familiar with some fighting techniques. Overall, there are a significant number of various ways to make crimes not so common. Personally I believe that all these methods can be efficient only when they are used together and by qualified and honest government. Reducing crime rate is a problem of the whole society, so it is to important reasonably  use all the possible ways.",7

Air travels are necessary part of global communication. They are the main reason of rapid globalization of the word. Reducing the amount of air travel will slow down the process of development. For example, if we compare development of world trade during USSR times. Then most flights were restricted with a period of modern Russia we will see that global trade and global travel of people are making both countries economics better.
It is also obvious that in a closest future there will be methods to reduce waste from planes. It will make flights completely safe for the environment. There are a lot of concepts of planes that are eforking on biofuel. As an example, Lochhead Martin presents a new engine that will decrease the amount of toxic traces. On the nearest future this project will be ready.
To sum up, there are no serious reasons for reducing flights. Ecological problems will only exist in short-term period and won't affect the global processes on Earth. In long-term period we will get ecologically clean planes that will make flights completely safe for the environment.

But what are the reasons of this tendency and what, more importantly, can be done, to prevent it from future exacerbation? These are the questions to discuss.

Firstly, the increasing level of juvenile deliquency can be explained by the amount of freedom, granted to people in general. Less severe gun control policies and the abolition of capital punishment in many states question the authority of the government for the common people. And young people are more perceptive to this rebellious spirit.
Secondly, the proportion of the youngsters does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the crime. So the increase in question may show not the rise in murders, but in rather less serious mischiefs, like, for instance, smoking in public places. And the growing proportion of the young people here can be explained by the absence of true crime in the eyes of young criminals, which, so to say, legalize such actions.

What about the measures to be taken, these are mostly the duty of parents and teachers. They ought to show their own respect to law by their own example and teach the importance of other people's life and property, as no one can guarantee one's own safety.

All in all, we should not jump the gun and blame violent films and videogames for the growing juvenile deliquency, as it is mainly the guilt of the system and people's nature, that nudges the youngsters towards mischief. But solutions do exist and measures can be taken to slow down this downward movement.",7

The decision is should be made: to ban athlets cought using them for a limited time or to definitely exclude them from competitions. This essay will discuss both points of view and find out the most suitable.
To start with, banning athlets for a confined period is obviously more humane. A person caught using prohibited drugs may understand it was awfull and make a remorse. Despite some athlets use them, they apparently need to be tought that it is a serious crime in sports. Sport doctors and other medicine personnel of teams should be blamed for allowing and even not knowing about athlet's illegal drugs using, of course.
However, there are people that think that sports societies should prohibit these athlets for the rest of their lives. This point of view is very strict, althoug the most evident solution to illegal drugs problem is a total ban of persons of such a reprehensible conduct. It may be argued that one who was once caught should be frightened of being caught again - this will predestine that culprit will never attempt to cheat once more. Evidently, the latter statement is fallacious: the one who used a drug in his or her past is likely to do it one more time. The sound argument for banning culpable athlets forever is that sport society needs to be cleaned from those who do not attain sport's moral code. This strict desicion will obviously maintain guaranted level of honest competition.
To conclude, two points of view have been discussed: one was to ban athlets using prohibited drugs for a period of time and other - to disqualificate them for the rest of their career. My opinion is that the latter is, despite being significantly rigid, the best solution to the issue of illegal drugs using. That's why I totally agree with it.

Also, road is mainly used for food products' transportation that occupate 30 percents of the whole road traffic. Unlike manufactured goods, food products only take 11 percents of the total amount of goods transported by the rail.

Success in career,achievements in sports, high social status and etc - all of it cqan involve in formula of happiness. I think, everyone has own opinion about happiness and thus it is very difficult to define it. However, I try to show which factors help to understand or define own formula of happiness and achieve it. First of all, people should think about their targets. If someone wants to be athlete,he should train much as possible. If someone wants to earn a lot of money, he should be creativy and pragmatic. On first view it is easy to find target and create plan. But life is moire difficult and people used to reorganise own activities and change targets. 
Moreover, people should to be less serious. Of course, if someone has important task, he should be serious. It relates to scientists, doctors, policemenand etc. 
However, people need to understand that life conditions may change and they will used to live with it. If people will be not serious, they will be less sressful and nervous,  when they review own targets. 
Furthermore, when someone define own targets, he should find right instruments to achieve it. If someone wants to be famous, but do nothing or don't have any talent, theycheck false target. People should realise own possibilities. 
Thus, it can be concluded, that it is very difficult to define happiness. It is very important to see own abilities, realiuse possibilities and find right target. Targets define a sense of life.

First of all, it is obvious that millennials at their current age have more opportunities and higher living standards than their parents or grandparents had. Young people often do not need to be concerned about how to help their family and so on. This results in a larger amount of free time, which, unfortunately, is not fully occupied by useful things such as sports or studying. In other words, young people have enough time to do whatever they want, which sometimes includes getting into “wrong” companies of friends, who can rob or attack innocent people just for the sake of fun. That is one of the mechanisms how young people can start to commit crimes.
Another reason of the described trend of more crimes committed by the young age group people might be as follows: current media produce a lot of content which is connected with cruelty, and young adults become more tolerant to crimes by wathing such content. For instance, news agencies often try to show some awful and scaring videos from the places of accidents such as airplane crushes, car accidents or terrorist attacks. Such videos spread extremely quickly in social networks, which are very popular among youngsters. As a result, especially this age group faces a lot of cruelty online through these videos.
In order to tackle the above-mentioned causes of the problem, I would, firstly, suggest creating multiple hobby clubs at schools, so that pupils could have a variety of things to do in their free time. Evidently, this measure would be even more effective, if school students had an obligation to attend at least several hobby clubs. As for the cruel content on TV and on the Internet, it can be wise to put more age restrictions on it. However, it is necessary to keep in mind the possibility of an opposite effect which in that young people might get angry, if they are prohibited to watch something. I believe that such effect can be avoided, if both mentioned measures are implemented, because then young people will not have time to try to watch prohibitted content. Also, parents should pay attention to what their children are occupied with.
To sum up, it is necessary to emphasize that the problem can be effectively addressed only if a combination of techniques is used. In this case both teachers at schools and parents at home should be attentive to the children and surround them with support. It would be the best way to destroy any incentives to commit crimes.

The development of education in Africa, according to the chart, is not that fast, compared to South Asia, there is a slight change: 27,5% fall for boys (20 million to 14,5 million) and less than 50% for girls (23,7 million girls in 2000 to 18,2 in 2012). However, performance of Africa is still beter than overall dynamics around the world: ""Rest of World"" column of the chart shows least decrease of all three: neither boys or girls numbers haven't changed even for 50%.

And the fact of corporation's existense usually deneds on their successful deals. In order to make one of those, CEO has to meet different people as often as he can. And there is no better mean of transport for CEO than airplane. 

Furthermore, in many countries, such as Greece, Malta, Egypt, Turkey etc. economy strongly depends on tourism. If the tourists flow decline in this countries, they will have economical problem, such as recession, big inflation or even default.

It is very hard for young people to find their place in the modern world. And the thought that they can get money without work seems very appealing to them. So, instead of studying at the schools and universities, they start, for example, selling drugs.
This lack of motivation to live a decent life boils down to a not proper raising them as a children. And this is a mistake of their parents and children. Parents and teachers should explain why it is morally wrong to lead a life of crime. They should spend more time on bringing them up and teaching them the right values.
Adults should also help the young generation to build a career. There would be no incentives to commit crimes, if earning money by a decent work was as easy as earning money by doing illegal things. Of course, that cannot be reached, but we should strive to that. Parents and teachers should encourage young people in their endeavors and not to discourage them from reaching their dreams.

As regards to me, I believe that rules and restrictions kill creativity and in this essay I will explain my point of view, using some examples from life.


At first, people in governments usually do not understand species of art at all. They are not competetive in this shere and can not be experts in questions of art. For example, nowadays in Russia some of modern exhibitions are closed because governments thought that they are bad and dangerous for people's minds. I find it really dissapointing.


Another argument for artists' freedom in work is that is the main feature of art process – creating something new. Art is always developing, new kinds and forms of it born every day. So how can governments and political organizations control it? It is evidence that in countries with strict art control and cenzure (like China and the North Corea Republic) art doesn't develop nowadays.


Meanwhile, artists should look at themselves too and do not produce things, which are evidently harmful for people. It is a difficult question and maybe sometimes official control is relevant. But the best way for artists is to make this control themselves.


To sum up, I really believe that government restrictions are not necessary, in the vast majority of these questions. Political and social control kill art and developments in this shere.

Nowadays people are keen on doing that, because it is one of the best ways to decompress after hard-working days. Someone prefers to watch a foreign comedy, while others are fond of local films, but the amount of latter decreases steeply.
I strongly believe, there are several reasons for this phenomenon. First and foremost, the USA and the UK are one of the most famous countries in the producing of films. Actually, their films are popular and they are shown all over the world. So, we can watch it even uncounsciously by switching on a TV or visiting a cinema, because there are plenty of such films everywhere. More than that, these countries invest a huge amounts of money in film's production. So, their films are made with a high professionalism, amusing costumes and backgrounds and the most world-wide famous actors. It all attracts watchers from the whole world. It is also undeniable, that the plot and scenes of British and American movies are more exciting. While, as for Russin films, their plots are rather monotonous and repeat from movie to movie. So, they become rather boring to watch and feel like routine. Additionally, we can get acquainted with different cultures, get to know their traditions and mental features through watching foreign films. I am absolutely sure, it makes people watch tese films, because not everyone has an opportunity to travel round the world, to see all the amazing places of our Earth, to meet new people and to make friends. But films allow them to ""touch"" and to look at the other cultures and absorb in their atmosphere.
Speaking about governments' financial support of their national films, I claim, that it is a must. Due to their investments local films will definetely become more dazzling, exciting and interesting. People from other places all the world will be able to expand their knowledge about the certain country. Furthermore, wathcing films made about local places attract these people as a tourists, as if they can see all the beautyness of a country, they definetely want to visit it. So, it can lead to the profit of the country's budget.
All things considered, British and American films are more perferable because of their professional production, exciting plots, amazing decorations, amusing costumes and famous actors. And locally produced films should be invested by the governments to be at the same level with such films.",8

It is a controvetial question whether governments have to set laws against air travelling. I completely disagree with the opinion that these laws should be introduced.
Personally, I consider that air travel is extremely important for businessmen and people in work because of globalization people more fluent in their movements, so they can easily go to another country thanks to planes. People need it, as usually they need to get international experience, to have new practice, communicate to foreign collegues. Moreover, more and more companies became international with filials in different regions, so people cannot lose time on transport in solving company's problems and they need a high speed means of transport.
Moreover, planes are significant transport for leisure activities. All people wish to travel and to explore new places for themselves. If it can be easily done on one materic, it would become a problem to go from Russia to America, for example. Without planes people would to travel by train, bus, ship, boat and on foot, which is both hard enough and pretty expensive. I can say with confedence that all members of my family adore to travel by planes, as it really convinient. 
Anyway, governments can introduce laws against air travelling. They can increase the prices on this type of trip and take much taxes from it. However, I strongly believed that it would be more effective if they concentrate on the problem in general and try to solve it by modernization the plants sources of energy, by making scientists to do their best on this question.
To sum up, air travelling is an essential part of people's lives all over the world, so it would be wrong and cruel not to let them to make such trips both for work and for rest. In my opinion, governments should not close their eyes on the problem of pollution and global warming, but they should develop innovative ways to deal with it, not by sacrificing the air travelling.

Firstly, I think that the society became more depraved nowadays, comparing with the past. It became cool to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, use drugs – it is connected with a stereotype of wild and funny life, which is shown to young people in the Internet and TV shows. Young people aren’t smart and wise enough to differentiate what is good and what is bad. They want to decide by themselves what life to live – that’s why they don’t listen to their parents and relatives, even if their advices are good and right. Secondly, nowadays there is an enormous pressure in lives of young men. They are asked to be good at school by their parents, then they try to enter the university, even if they have to take huge student loans. After the university there will be a job with mammoth working hours. Then, kids, family… Only after a retirement they might be happy! It is a long hard way. If a young man makes a mistake at one of these steps he may think that he lost everything and that he would never be successful. So, if there aren’t incentives to be good, why can’t he become bad?
I think that in order to decrease the level of crimes commited by young men the whole teaching system should be changed. Schools and universities should shift from pressure and everlasting competition among students to giving them opportunities to explore the world and find themselves. Also, the society should change ideals that are dictated by the media – from money, superficial beauty, luxury life to love, kindness, truly happy life.

And many researches ask the question: “Who will be this children?”. As for scientists’ opinions, they will become crimers, alcoholics and murders. Nevertheless to this sad tendention, we can see that in South Asia this social issue will disappear soon. In 2012 there were only 5.1 million boys and 4.8 girls without the opportunity to study in Primary School. But the location play an important role. As graph shows, in Africa this problem is solving slowly. Comparing 2000 and 2012, we can see that proportions came down only for 11%. The reason is bad and poor conditions of Africa region. Rest of World have better conditions, they have 23.3 at 2000 and 15.3 at 2012.
In conclusion, I want to say that children should go to school in all cases. Education helps children to know this difficult world. And in my opinion, kids shouldn’t be hurted by governments mistakes.

In fact, modern children and teenagers have got freedom of actions not realising, though, a higher responsibility they are to bear now in comparison with the same age group of the past. Indeed, it is vital for their mentors, first of all, to take urgent measures in order to seize the control of youths' behaviour. In this essay I will analyse the main reasons for such a trend proposing a number of possible ways as how to change it.

The first factor that have a negative impact on children's mind is the media. Actually, the abundance of TV programs, newspaper articles and other sources demonstrate real murders, terroristic attacks, just horror films that people get used to very quickly despite the age. For this reason, parents and teachers should track what their children watch and read at school as well as during their leisure controlling state of their mind.
Another cause of the aggressif behaviour is simply the lack of attention. Unfortunately, nowadays parents are often too busy working their way up the career ladder so that young people have to spend most of the time only on their own. That is why, it is essential, as much as possible, to discuss with children their problems, friends, plans for future. The same is true for teachers, they could organise some meetings of psychological grounds, for instance, in order to get close to students and provide them with an opportunity to voice their worries and ideas.

Finally, young people often follow a slippery slope becoming criminals because they have nobody to look up to. It is necessary for a growing individual to take an invaluable life experience after their mentors. To put it another way, parents as well as teachers should share their skills with children setting a positive example to them. Also they can help them to find a prominent social figure to follow who would inspire children throughout the whole life.

Taking everything into account, modern young people are heavily influenced by the community they are exposed to. In order to draw a line under the number of crimes commited by youths, it would be really feasible, in any case, for parents and teachers to bring harmony to their relationship paying a significant attention to their wishes and needs.",7

I strongly disagree with this statement, as other factors should be considered during application.
To start with, the level of education is the most important factor of future students. That is why, school marks and examinations results have to be taken into account. Consequently, if there are more men with high exams marks than women, there is no reason for accepting the equal quantity of male and female students.
Moreover, some occupations are so specific that it would be hard to teach men and women to work at these jobs. For instance, girls are more likely to become nurses than boys, but it is hard to work with steel or oil for them.
However, there is another point of view. Some people are sure that we have to provide the equal rights for both sexes in the process of university attendance. Their main argument cannot be taken into consideration, because giving the same rights to people has to be linked with providing the best opportunities for people who are more talanted and eager to achieve the success in their lives.
In conclusion I can say that I cannot agree with the opinion that universities have to accept equal quantities of male and female applicants. I strongly believe that other factors are more crusial than person’s sex, such as his or her knowledge and professional qualities.

However, metals are likely to be transported by rail.

But, on the other hand, there are some similarities in figures. The percentage of transported manufactured goods almost equals on the two charts. The same situation is seen with transportation of chemicals. Transportation by road is only five percent bugger than transportation by rail.

Nowadays people of different professions are arguing about punishmets for prisoners who commited a crime.Some of them state that living in the cells in prison for a long time is a good way for criminal to change and become a good person. Others can not agree with that point of view and they are looking forward to create new procedures of recovering.
Fist of all, we should not forget that in ancient times in all big and developing countries in the courts judges usually made verdicts that took people's lives. All the citizens followed the process and then the criminal was accused and sent to the death thay went to the main square in their city and looked at the punishment. It was very cruel and violent but goverment suggested that such public performance helped them to keep their power and prove that their political decisions were right. However, nowadays human rights exist and most of countries signed an agreement where they had rejected killing criminals.
Secondly, long sentences can be very useful if the atmosphere of this facility is helping criminals to unedrstand their gilt, to apologise themselves and others, to become a new person and be ready to return to the society. Of course, it sounds very idealistic but I think that it should be the main purpose of each prison. Moreover, the prison's stuff should not fight with the criminals and hurt them, they all should undestand their psycological and physical problems and try to help them to deal with it.
To conclude, I would like to say that at the moment there is no good way to turn a criminal into normal person. On one hand people who are against prisons do not propose other options of making criminals better. On the other hand, long sentences can be very tough for an unstable minds of a criminals and even can kill them. So, I guess that it is a very big problem and everyone should draw their attention on it.",6

There is no doubt that it is an enormous harm to our nature and I dare say that to some degree air travel should be limited. Lets delve a little bit deeper on this issie. 
  Firstly, according to research by scientists, wich claim that it will be hard to breath without special equipment within 120 years on our planet, government should take immedeate actions to solve this problem, in particular, make a limit for it's own country for air flights per year, because air transport is the most polluting way of travel in comparison with other ways of transport.
  Secondly, people who have money and power take their own private airplanee only because of comfort, and they travel by their own with pilots, not wish stending the fact that such plain cun tuke hundreds of people. And that is why goverment should make a threshhold of people per cur plane. It will sufficiently stop the pollution.
  However, if we look at opposite arguments we will see that to some extent air travel can come in a handy. I dare say that some professions should be allowed to use air transport. For instance, there should not be any ban for doctors that use airplanes in order to help people because it is  the question about life and death.
  In inference it should be mentioned that some laws for reducing the usage of air travel for business and leisure must be developed by goverment. But they must take into account all exceptations.

I presume that the main causes of such development are dramatic increase in technologies, its’ availability for wide masses and, as a result, lower engagement in social interactions of young people.
To start with, now children and adolescents spend much less time outside, playing football or any other sport with their covenants. As a result, their communication has altered its form and transferred from streets to computers: it is a fact that young people nowadays communicate using social networks more, than in the real life. Besides, the development of online entertainment industry, and namely computer games development, has a significant impact on lack of socialisation among adolescents. Moreover, computer games like shootings or fightings, as well as many videos in the Internet, promote violence towards young people’s minds. All this negative phenomena influence harmfully a modern society.
However, parents and teachers can solve this problem. The formers should not allow their children to spend too much time with their computers and other devices, as well as they should restrict time spending in social networks. Furthermore, parents have to walk more with their children, encourage them to do sport and interact with other children. The latters, teachers, should offer to pupils such interesting topics that would encourage them to study rather than play computer games. Moreover, group projects can increase students engagement in studying and interacting with each other too.
To sum up, rise in quantity of crimes is a great problem and parents and teachers should try to tackle this problem.

Culture was under strong pressure, strict censorship ruled artists. As people did not have freedom to express themselves, art became very standardised.
As a result, chinese culture not only stopped it’s development, but alco dropped on a imposing level.
The only thing now censorship should influence on culture is to narrow areas of public publication but it should not forbid to create.

The speed of spreading of some brand new movies or music could be compared with the speed of light, especially if we talk about spreading in social net works.
On the one hand, these information leaks can be really dangerous on finances for producers. Moreover, the process of filming or recording music is very expensive. Some experts suggest that losses from pirates increasing twice annually. Ordinary people find it easier to find interesting films on the Internet than to go out and watch it on the full screen. Because of it movie producers lose their income. After all, creating movies has become a non-profit process.
On the other hand, there are a lot of more pros than cons from illegal information spreading and leaks for musicians. The main point is that: if people do not have to pay for music they want to listen to, then they will download and share it with their friends. Firstly, if they like this music, they will buy tickets for the bands sigs. or pay for officiall copies (on iTunes or CDs). All in all we see that if something is for free, more people will listen it. In this ease some musicians post their new albums or songs absolutely for free. The best example is Radiohead. They just let their fans pay as much as they want (or nothing at all) for the new album.

Firstly, the reason of youth crime may be the media. A lot of violence is shown on TV: there are a lot of movies where criminals are shown as heroes. Teens are vulnerable, they look at this and try to imitate this. So, the media just put them on the wrong path this way.
The solution to this problem is simple. First of all, parents should take control of what their child watches. They should not allow their children to watch too much television during the day and try to organize their free time, so that the
Secondly, the reason of increasing of youth crime may be the high consumption of drugs and alcohol between the youngsters. This makes the psychic of a young person unreasonable and they easily can commit a crime or do other bad things.
First of all, again parents must protect their child from this by controlling his behavior. Also teachers at school may try to influence their pupils by making special meetings, debates.
To sum up, unfortunately, crime committed by young people is a common problem of 21st century. There are several reasons for it, and some actions should be taken to preserve it. Parents and teachers are mostly in favor of influencing young people as they spend a lot of time with them and they have enough experience to help young people choose the right way and not to ruin their life by becoming a criminal.",6

On the one hand, the air transport is the fastest type of transportation. It takes a few hours or even minutes to come places of destination, which are a far miles away. Moreover, it is the safetiest transport. Another kind of transport, for example cars, are much more dangerous than airplanes. According to statistics everyday in the world happen more than 100 car acsidents, which lead to an increase of air pollution. To follow this theme, other type of transportation produce pollution too. Possible, in the complex this kind much more dangerous for the inveroments, than airplane. these are worth attention of the government.
On the other hand, air transport is the most expensive of all. It is built of the alluminius, which is a waste. In addition if consume a lot of fossil fuils and money for repairing and constraction., This costs can be use in more useful areas, such as education.
To sum it up, government should provide a complex of programmes for reducing an air pollution and to begin with the lond type of transportation. They should invest in science, especially, in project for replaces the traditional veichecles by eco transport, and to encourage people to use bicycle.

People always look into their smartphones and computers because a constant modern lifestyle is required that behaviour.

This everyday routine becomes a standard. The next problem is a less of a sport activities. It caused by technologies too.  People  do not get out of a house because they have all things for proper life. If they have to, they can use the Internet shops and buy a necessary products. Moreover, there is a problem with sleep, because people tend to spend a half of a whole day in the Internet, and even sleep with their smartphones.

However, there are some ways to tackle this problems. To begin with, people could think more about some breaks in a work. If he or she will be sitting in a proper position and more away from the computer just for ten minutes in hour, there will be less problems with the eyesight. Furthemore, people need to walk, ride a bicycle or do some other activities during the day or they will be fired. For example, it is a fact, that a person, who is walking at least thirty minutes in a day, will be more productive in a work. All of people depend in technology, so, the main solution of the health problems is to reduce the time of using gadgets. 

In conclusion, modern technology is an important part of people’s life and it helps in many ways, tackle many problems and do life more easy. By contrast, it creates other problem and destroy our health. However, only people responsible for their body and mind condition and all the problems from too much time of usage gadgets.

As a result, the government wants to delay travels for business and leisure. As for me, I agree with a big importance of climat and air pollution but I think that this law will make more problems. I have three explanations why the law which reduces amount of business and leisure travels is a bad idea. To start with, the business travel is very important for a communication between companies from different countries. This communication provides countries by new financial assets which help for economy growth. If the government prohibit business travel, the stream of money can confront a lot of difficults and foreign companies will stop communicating. Then the country will threat a lot of losses which slowen the economic growth. The second point is a possible lack of entertainment for population. If they like relaxing at other countries, the government shouldn’t prohibit to do it. Because there are countries which specialized on leasure and it is their part of the world work distribution. The last but not least, if government doesn’t allow to travel to other countries, they should make own entertainment sphere which replaces foreign one. However, it is a big investment and a lot of time which are not available for some countries. The opposite side supposes that the air pollution is a very crucial problem and each country should fights against if because of global warming. It is dangerous because of a raising temperiature which kills some types of animals and plants. However, plants produce clear air for people in order to the global warming is a serious problem for future generations. As for the second point of view, I believe that there are a lot of other problems which causes global warming such as waste, car traffic and others. So that I suggest that the government should reduce impact of these factors which help people and environment. All in all, the law reducted amount of air travel is illogical and global warming is caused by a lot of factors which are easy for interacting.

The first cause of such behaviour can be vulnurability of young people. They can be influenced a lot easier than children who still see their parents as authorities or adults who are more responsible for their actions and are aware of how they can effect their future. The teenagers need to show that they are worth being respected by all means. This is why they are being used in commiting crimes. Another possible reason may be lust for money and luxurious life. If parents are not able to give their children money or if they are just poor, young people will try to seek for another opportunity to get them. Since they do not have higher education, the only way some children find is committing crime.
First plausible solution to the problen can be envolving teenagers in different kinds of voluntary work. In this case they will learn that it is much better to help other people than to harm them in any way. Another variant may be opening some vacancies for young people either during summer time or in their free time. Through this important experience they will understand how hard it is to earn money and will not have to ask their parents for cash. Moreover, as for working with the teenagers who have already committed crimes meetings with prisoners can be arranged, who will tell these young children how they really regret doing that. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is highly important to show young children the consiquencies of committing crimes, to make them realise that it is not an easy way of getting money.",7

That can be said either about girls and boys in these regions. The overall tendency is that in every regions there was a decreasing of the rate (the most dramatic was in South Asia though), and this trend is considered to be a real result of all the supporting policies.

This provides us with execellent oppurtunities to learn more, to explore more and to unite by means of investigating in our future. However, I'd like to agree that the statement given has something to do with the reality and some kinds of space-exploring activities seem to be not so clear.

Staying at the track of contraversary, I would like to introduce the reasons why certain kind of space exploration really appears to be some kind of a waste. I'm mostly speaking of kind of entertainment in space. Such an idea is building an orbiting hotel in space which, in my opinion, leads the chart of stupidity. Merely one would list reasons for such kind of enormous investment. Such waste becomes actually disgusting when taking into account such downearth problems as poverty, hunger, ecology and inequality. I tend to think that huge investment needs to be backed up with the reality and the key point is that such kind of investment is obliged to be atleast useful not speaking of effectiveness.

With the cons mentioned, it is the point to move to pros. As I've already mentioned, space exploration appears to be a leading power for human progress of enormous strength. Exploring space may lead to inventing tons of different things we are everyday in need for. For example inventing new kinds of meds, new sources of energy, recieving some explanations of how the life works on our planet. So, basically, by investing into scientific cosmos exploration we are to move forward in our progress which, as for me, would undoubtedly lead to increase of the quality of life. And improving overall quality of life is another crucial feature of scientific space investment especially when speaking of much important downearth I've mentioned above. The majority of such problems could be solved by means of improving quality of life or for example inventing new energy sources.

To sum everything up, I tend to somehow agree with the statement given in terms of the reasons of space exploration and it's relevance for downearth reality. That is to say, that we are to carefully take into account our needs and abilities before entering the space and spending insane sum of money. We are to focus on whats relevant for today and hence we are to invest in such fields and, as for me, scientific space exploration is an excellent opportunity for reaching our goals, mostly, for progressing and improving the quality of life.",7

The chart includes the period of 12 years (from 2000 to 2012) in Africa, South Asia and the Rest of World, dividing children by gender.

The most striking feature is that Africa seems to be a leader with its approximately 44 millions of children in 2000th. It is obvious that more girls than boys are not allowed to be educated all in all. In 2012 still about 30,6 million girls have not access to primary schools.

It is important to say that South Asia has successfully overcome the problem: the number of uneducated children decreased from 33 to only 10 millions in past 12 years. Moreover, South Asia destroyed the gender discrimination in educational sphere, because in 2012 the percentage of girls and boys is almost 50 to 50. Overall, the main trend is decreasing a number of children without pimary education all over the world.

Society of the whole country started to think about the reasons of rising level of crime among youth. We can name several causes of such development.
Firstly, young adults can be mistreated in their families and deprived of proper health care, sometimes suffering from abuse and neglection. Secondly, modern school education concentrates the most of its effort on learning scientific subjects, but there's no lessons of proper behaviour and ethical attitude to the world. Thirdly, no serious measures are taken against young criminals as they are often viewed as children with no responsibility.
The first thing that can be done to improve the situation is educating the parents about basic needs of their children, such as food, health care, clothes, appreciation at the school class. Awareness can be spread with open and free educational seminars for parents of teenagers and children. The main advantage of such approach is an ability to discuss the topic of child and teenage care with a specialist. Unfortunately, parents who wouldn't attent such meetings can still spread abusive pattens.
In order to solve the second problem we should change the list of the school subjects, adding lessons of ethical and tolerant behaviour in the society. A council of teachers and specialists in the field of school education should deside on the most comfortable and easy way to organise the classes. The positive effect of the classes is improvement of critical thinking skills among young adults, including potential criminals. Unfortunately, the lack of universal behaviour rules and cultural difference can cause arguments and conflicts between teachers and parents
The third key to the problem of youth criminals is adding more severe punishments for the young intruders. Such measures of punishment as life inprisonment and death penalty should be included to the list of measures taken against young people who commited severe murders and caused significant harm. As a result, young people will be afraid of the punishment, having real-life examples in front of their eyes. The main disadvantage of such approach is the negative reaction on fear and vieving such measures as a therror.
In general, young criminals rob houses and commit the murders because of family abuse, lack of education and being sure to recieve no real punishment. In my opinion, the main workon improvement of the situation should be done by parents and teachers by spreading the knowledge and improving relationships between teens and adults.",7

It is widely considered that such copying is illegal and should be punished. Still, the are some opposing points of view, that should be taken into account.
On the one hand, enormous amounts of money are not only spent by musicians and film producers on making media product, but also lost from pirate copying. In other words, media-makers don’t get as much money as they deserve for selling their product, but also suffer high costs of production. These costs should be at least partly covered by the price paid by consumers. Otherwise, such uncontrolled copying can lead to crisis in media industry. That means, that quantity and quality of media products would reduce if only rich media-producers could afford to create unit of media. For this reason, it is better to punish people, who share and download pirate copies.
On the other hand, media-makers make a lot of money for presentation of their media-products at a public places (like concerts, cinemas etc). Still, many people don’t earn enough money to spend them on pieces of culture. Unfortunately, the majoritys households income is only enough to buy good of first need, like food and cloths. If free downloading is strictly forbiden, the cultural degradation of the society may began. People, especially young one, need an access to free media products in order to discover the world, life and their personality.
To conclude, I consider that pirate copying should not be punished, as cultural development f the society must be in priority before some amount of money lost by another media producer.

It is also considerable that if a government would spend more money to support local film industries then films produced would be more prefered.
Today, English-language culture became a world pop-cilture, so American and British films are also watched by people to improve their English. But if it was only about language, people would also watch Australian and South African films. There are some reasons for English and Americans films being more popular all over the world. For example, biggest film-producing corporations are situated in US, so it is obvious that in US are produced many more films espetially hero-movies, trillers, comedies and dramatical ones. All those films became a part of international pop-culture and if you watch, for example, superhero films you always have a topic to discuss with someone who has absolutely different local culture than you and who lives on the other side of our planet.
The quality of film does not correlate with money spent on it so much: there are a huge number of great and popular low-budget films. There is a popular opinion that locally produced films are more specific for the country where they were produced, for example, what is filmed in Balkan countries hardly would be understanded by West European people for language shifts and life style. And it is also conciderable that local films are more abstract and experimental, so the cultural background is really important.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the world popular culture has a very big influence on local films. Those folms which would be understood by people all over the world would be more popular.",7

Everyday people use smartphones, laptops and a lot more widely ranged devices. It is clearly understood that a human nowadays can not live without technology. Although it makes people's life easier in several ways, it can seriously damage health. and be a cause of increasing amount of health problems.
First of all, most of devices include different screens, that produce light, which can be very destructive for people's eyes, especially during a long eyecontact. Using smartphones and laptops is considered dangerous due to this influence. Moreover, it should be mentioned that most of devices are used while sitting, so there is a real lack of motion in some people's life. This can result in ache in back's muscles and bones. Very often people, who spend a lot of time in front of their computers, suffer from overweight. And the list of health problems can be much longer.
It is understood, that people have to take care of theirselves and be more attentive to their health. First of all, they have to limit the time they spend using technical devices. Parents should strictly control their children using smartphones and computers to let their eyes rest for screen's light. Furthermore, there should be special breaks for physical activites in offices, where workers spend almost all their day in one position.
To sum up, technologies are essential part of modern life, but people should understand their negative effects on health. So it is very important to limit the time spent with technical devices and to have an active lifestyle.

As a student of sociology faculty, I can not agree with the scientists completely although I admit that both the characteristics we are born with and experiences we may have in our life have some influence. In my opinion and the sociological point of view, the socialisation during our life and especially in our childhood plays the leading role in forming our personality characteristics. There are a lot of examples when two twins who lived in different families could not understand each other when they had met because of differences in their values and life understanding.
Not only sociologists, but also psychologists strongly believe that it is very important for children to live in a good family and communicate with kind, polite and intelligent people while growing up, because it will influence and enhance his life in the future. In addition, I have to tell that most children who were socialised in the streets and communicated with bad companies in their childhood could not became successful and wealthy people. Meanwhile, children from poor families who communicated with children from wealthy families had more chances to enter the university and had a better job later. So the genes can be a bit neutralised by a good socialisation tactic.
In conclusion I have to say that, in my opinion, both the characteristics we are born with and the experience in our life have a great impact on our personality, but our personal experience and the society we live in influence more considerable.

In my opinion first reason is gender equality nowadays the percentage of womens who has a job is higher than ever before, therefore they has less time for take care of their children. So children has more freedom than ever before.

They separetes in two groups. One group thinks that the best way to reduce crimes is to give long prison sentences.Another group thinks that they become better if they are given alternative methods of reducing crime.
The first method can be effective, but it does not give us the garantie of their changes. They can have a long prison sentence, be in prison, make there works, hard works and after that, for example,after 25 years, they will not realise what they have done bad, for them it can be only a crime and they can do it one more time. Also, I do not want to say that all people behave themselves at the same way. After a long prison time they can be better, because they want to forget that bad time and live a new life.
Others think about alternrtive methods. Yes, it can be effective, they can realize what they have done, but they can think if they killed one person and do not have prison sentences, they will can kill another person and will not have a punishment. The same situation with changes can be and in this sutuation when the prisoner has an alternitive punishment and after that way of reducing crime they can be more lifefriendly and want to forget all this time.
In my opinion, I think that better way to reduce the crimes is to give longer prison sentenses. For me, Killer, Who killed a lot of people, must be in a prison, because I do not want that one of them was among us. It is dangerous for people. Also, I think that every person would like to punish this person who killed someone, because bad emotions Fulfill us and we want give to this killer all, that can give him the same felling that we have at this bad moment.",6

One of the most significant reasons of this trend is that the level of violence among young people has risen; they don't respect the law, and it's high time to explain them that crime is not good. So, parents, teachers and the government should help them.
For beggining, it is important to understand the reasons of their behaviour. First of all, there is a lot of crime on TV and the Internet. If we turn on a TV, we will see how people kill each other and other schenes of violence. Thus, young people can think that crime isn't something unusual if they see it everyday. Secondly, today young people have a feeling of freedom, and they think that a person can do whatever he wants even if it is a crime. Thirdly, maybe it is the main cause of their behaviour, today it is the high rate of unemployment in the world. So, young people don't have a job; however, they have a lot of free time and need money. As the result, a crime is a possible solution for them.
Nevertheless, the issue isn't extremly complicated. If parents explain their children the harm from the violence, they will not make crimes. In addition, speial lecturers can be created in schools to show the possible punishments for criminality. Moreover, the government should create job places for young people; it will help them to find money.
To sum up, the problem can be solved if we pay more attention for it. The support from family, school and the government will help young people to find their place in life.

First for all we have to decide for yourself is the process of globalization good or bad. If there are more pros than cons, we should admite the negative side of globalization, like the air pollution as a fact, which can not be totally solved. And now turning to globalization process, in my opinion it has more pros than cons: I am an international student and I have to use aircraft to go to my home country. While the process to globalization is developing, the aviatickets become more more cheeper, which allows me to bye them. If the government decides to reduce the number of air travels, we could see the demand on air travel will dramatically increase. It will leed to that fact, that the aviatickets become more expensive, which cannot be bought by ordinary people. It will be the example of social inequality, which will influence negatively on government reputation. In conclusion, I think that the air pollution a not subject of an issue, because cars produce much more polute gases than anything else, by the way. Governments shouldn’t introduce laws of remove the amount of using polute machines, however governments may influence on technology side. For example, to develop and implement laws, which don’t allow people to use vey polute machines. Laws have to represent standart of allowed pollution. To sum up, governments shouldn’t implement tough measures to solve this problem, but have to implicate modern methods and economic instruments in order to make producing of pollution rather expensive, that it will not damage environment like in present times.

Firstly not all people have enough money to efford a Bly-ray DVD, subscription to Netflex but they still want to watch movies and listen to music they like. I think that musicians and TV-produers should give an option to the person to pay money or not, because this way they will be more generous to their fans. The famous Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky publish his books with millions of copies and he gives an opportunity to download it from the Internet for free In one of his interview he said he wanted to let everybody to read it and the appreciation of this work is worth much more than money. Actually people still would buy a paper book after reading. Electronic version if they really liked it and enjoyed reading. The same thing with music if the song really touchs your soul most people prefer to pay for a high-quality song. So the are no need to punish people who let us to try some movies and music and then decide of we want it to buy 
Secondly, some educational movies should be avaliable to watch them for free, because forcing people to pay for basic knowledge of world leads to the uneducated nations and global problems – so at least Discovery and National Geographic programs should not take fee.
It’s not a secret for everybody that companies lose lots of money because of illegal sharings of their files but I don’t think it’s a crucial question for them So copywriters should not be punished for their actions.

Us for me, I think that opinion can not be absolutely wrong. I am sure that modern technology have some influence on our life and health. For instance, there are a lot of situation when people have headack because of phones, computers and other. Also, it is possible to notice that between young people there are many boys and girls with not very good eyes. It is mean that despite usefulness of difference gafgets, they are able to bring some harm for health.

 On the other hand, I am not sure that all of us problem in health are goes from technology. Overall, human have not reduced illness be for the widespread using of gadgets. In contrast, I believe that a lot of modern technology can be able to help to solve any healthy problem. For example, there are a lot of scientist who nowadays have crucial research about cancer and another important illness.

In general, it is possible to say, that it is very important to use modern technology the we have more right, because despite their useful function, they may be not very good for people’s life. However, new technology are able to give us opportunity to go on the next step in reducing different crucial issues, like problems in healthy. So, I believe that people can use modern technology more useful.

Air travel can be one of the possible reasons for the environment to be harmed especially in terms off air pollution. Some people suppose that the best way to reduce the number of flights is government politics, restricting air travel rules and introducing new laws. However, othe people tend to think, that the precise number of flights is not important, while the very proccess of flight, the specifics of airplanes and fossil fuels utilized play the actual role.

As far as each person may know, incroducing environmentally friendly technology is a kind of problem all over the world. First of all, it sould be mentioned, that it costs huge amounts of money. Water clearing equipment or car emissions filters are effective but very difficult to get, prepare and use. Special equipment, which would be used to prevent harmful consequences of air pollution made by airplanes, is hard to fetch and serve. Moreover, it brings a significant problem for state's budget, making flight prices grow steadily and reducing commercial benefits. Taking this into consideration, we can see, that environmental protection based on special equipment, used for modifying airplens, clearing fossil fuels is not so effective as it may initially be seen
On the other hand, it can be proposed, that all the air travel companies should arrange the number of flights they offer, so as to reduce the actual amount of airplanes used. Business or leisure travel made should be suggested less often and only emergency flights or insutrial goods carrying flights might be maintainted at the same level. Firts of all, this way of sollution the air pollution problem seems to be less harmful for economics: while environmental solution mentioned above demands extra expenses on special equipment, this proposal suggests reducing the amount of benefits maintaining the mechanism of the average air flights scheme. Secondly, modyfying airplanes will take much more time that introducing of air flight rules and laws which will probably keep more passengers consuming air travel offers. As we may see, judical or legal way of transforming air travel business (for environmental purposes) tends to be the most effective and less harmful for both passengers and businessmen.

To sum it all up, it should be said, that now the most beneficial way to solve all the problems connected with environmental problems out of air travel is to have some changes in flight politics. Introducing laws and rules, rearranging air travel system means saving the very principle of air travel business, helping the environment at the same time, which seems paradoxically less devoted to environment but more environmentally friendly and effective.",7

Therefore there is an urgent need to counteract juvenile delinquency. The aim of the essay is to look into the possible causes of this problem and consider the measures which could be taken to solve it.

First of all, violence is propagated in numerous films and TV shows. Teenagers watching TV series depicting crime often get the impression that it is is an acceptable way of earning money and becoming successful. For this reason, I believe that discussing such films and TV programmes at school will help to change young people's attitude to this issue. Personally, I remember a round table discussion at school concerning a detective series of dubious quality, and all the students agreed that it should be banned because of the nagative values promoted in it.

Secondly, there is an infinite variety of computer games which involve fighting or killing. Some adolescents adopt a wrong bahaviour pattern while playing such games and become more aggressive. As a result, there are more murders carried out by youngsters. To my mind, parents should put a restriction on such games and encourage their children to acquire other hobbies, such as sports.

Another contributing factor to the high number of law violations by teenagers is unemployment. Some youngsters fail to find themselves a proper job and, consequently, tend to compensate for their shortage of money by shoplifting or even burglaring. That is why parents should be more helpful to their children in terms of their financial problems, and teachers should pay greater attention to explaining laws and regulations to their students.


To conclude, there are a number of factors due to which adolescents engage in illegal activities. However,there is a range of strategies to reduce crime rate among young people, and it is parents' and teachers' duty to implement them.",8

To put it more precisely, manufactured goods transportation accounts for 25 per cent of all goods transported by rail, and, concerning the road type, the percentage is slightly more at 28 per cent. The percentage of transported chemicals is not significant in both cases: that is less than a quarter, 11 per cent and 16 per cent by rail and road respectively.

Some people may claim that these high numbers are the result of modern society decay, so that young generation has no moral values to hinder their crime. However I claim that this is not most important reason. To me, it is developing technology that lead to the feeling of lesser crime responsibility, thus youngsters are not afraid of punishment any more. What is left to their life mentors is to increase their morality so that in the world of increased crime opportunity it would be inner rightness preventing people from illegal deeds.
On the other hand, many elder people now consider youngsters as a spoiled generation with wrong behaviour and no moral constraints. That is why crime rate surged - that is what they think. However, if we look in the history, there were thousand of similar cases in Ancient Greece, European revification period and etc. It is a human psychology feature to think that subsequent generation are worse than they are, that morality fell sharply during their life.
I personally believe that crime rate grew mainly because of increased crime opportunity. We live in the epoch of developing technologies where it is really easy to rob the bank servers, steal electronic money and even order a crime with the help of illegal websites. For example, Tor is an effective platform for buying guns, distributing drugs and etc. Thus, it became really easy to do illegal things with less chances to be caught.
To conclude, we should return to moral aspect of crime. Governments can no longer prohibit illegal paths blocking the sites, while they will open again somewhere else - it is just a matter of time. A thorough moral remedy should be considered to cure youngsters and the society itself.
Diminish crime reasons, so that the problem would disappear.

But these days, there are a lot of people who are not happy at all. On what depends that feel of happiness and why it is so hard to achieve it?
This problem became burning nowadays.
Since ancient times people have been thinking of happiness and the ways of achieving it. No one has said certainly what happiness is yet, so there are various concepts.
Some argue that happiness is personal well-being, others claim that happiness is money. In different epoches here were special determinations of happiness. Earled people were happy if they were healthy, not hungry and could make their living.
Nowadays, people are aiming for popularity, fame, power, respect and forget about relations. Their goals are very hard to achieve, but in fact it I a false hope syndrome. Whe you are famous you are barely happy. So I strongly believe that society and mass media disorientate people who are searching happiness.
I know people who believe that happiness is harmony between a human being and nature. But if we look at the newspapers, we will see deforestation, destruction of natural habitat. So it is impossible to achieve this harmony due to modern circumstances.
Some people believe that happiness is beaty and art. But art has also become spoiled by business, so it is impossible to destinguish beauty from fake. Such problems lead to disappointment and unhappiness.
To sum up, I would like to say that it is society and mass media who make it so difficult to define happiness. Everybody could be happy in his own way, but modern life can easily make it roller with up-to-date standarts of well-being, beauty and harmony.

However, it is not the most ecologically friendly, and many people claim that it significantly contributes to air pollution and global warming. Whether governments should restrict the use of airplaines to help to prevent serious ecological problems is a controversial issue worth discussing.
There are warious advantages in travelling around the world on the airplane. First of all, one cannot disagree that it is the fastest way to reach a destination. For example, nowadays it is possible to get from America to Australia in about 15 hours, which some years ago seemed absolutely impossible. In addition, airlines may be the only way to help to connect some areas that are situated far away from each other or that people were previously unable to reach. Moreover, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure can cause warious difficulties in international communication, cause economical declines in some countires, due to the decreasing number of tourisits visiting them, and may even cause some political problems.
However, it is also hard not to admit the fact that air travel does actually pollute the air. Firstly, since the number of people willing to travel increases every year, the number of aircompaies and airplanes they provide increases respectively. Secondly, in order to lessen the amount of time spent in the air, airplanes that companies produce become faster and stronger and thus, need more fuel and produce more waste. Thirdly, there are another means of transport that are also becoming more popular, such as ships or trains, which may be more ecologically friendly, than modern airplanes.
In conclusion, it can be stated that even though airplanes may not be the most ecologically-friendly way of transportation, it does not seem easy and helpful to reduce thei use. Personally, I understand the concerns that some people may have, however I think that there must be another way to solve environmental problems.

The first point of view suggests that doenloading music or films freely is normal thing. Their first argument is that they don’t want to spend their money or things, which they can get without paying e.g. music, films. The second argument is that oftenly one can find in the internet things, which one can’t buy, for example, old publications or old films and music, etc. the last argument is that sometimes one need to get something right now, but can’t buy it in shops or in the Internet. Working on your course work, you might need documental films, but oftenly they are not for sale.
The second group of people disagree with it. Firstly, they argue that musicians and film-makers spend a lot of money on their products and it’s unjustice not to pay for it. For example, a lot of singers nowadays ask their fans to buy legal copies of new albums or download it from official websites for fee. Secondly, they say that it’s a exome, because there is a law about protection of author’s rights in the big range of countries. As one know, there’re a lot of precedents, when singer or film-maker won the processes against websites, where their products could be downloaded freely.
To sum up, the society is divided on two sections about this issue: the first one says that downloading things freely shouldn’t be charged bad, however, the second one argues that it is amoral and illegal and it should be punished. Unfortunately, this question is still debatable.

The approach of building more sports facilities is really straight-forward. Those who vote for it believe that there is a proportion between the amount of people who do sport and the number of stadiums and such. Be that as it may, they thinks it`s the best way. On the one hand, this seems like a nice and simple solution, also because these facilities will be of use to professional sportsmen.
On the other hand, it may not be so simple. First of all, because in order for these facilities to run properly, it takes a lot of resources for its staff, maintenance an the energy it consumes. Many people think that this is not cost-effective. They suggest measures like promoting sports, especially outdoors. It is said to be cheaper and more effective to motivate people to do sports by themselves, without necessarily using special sports facilities. Also, they say that it`s very effective to take care of your nutrition, as it has a great influence on the way we feel. 
I personally think that building new sports facilities is a good measure. But certainly not the best. I believe that public health is more than just doing sports. But even if we talk about sport, motivation is much more important than the amount of sports facilities around. The motivation to do sports is what makes people do it, not the stadiums.
All in all, this problem appears to have interesting points to discuss. I believe that a concensus does exist here.

Namely, the amount of chemicals delivered by trains was only 5% lower than one by trucks: 11% and 16% respectively. Similarly, 25% of manifactured goods were transported with the help of trains and 28% - by road.

Many people stands on the position that the lack of attention of teachers and parents causes this situation, however, there are another angle of view. In this essay several aspects of this problem and possible variants of their solutions would be provided.
To start with, the problem of rising amount of murders and robberies may be affected by the Hollywood action films. The most popular genre in the XX century includes all the aspects of dark life. Moreover, in the three quarters of them main characters are members of mafia or want to join it. Parents or teachers may try to attend kids to listen to a classic music, watch ballet or participate in a chess championship, but the way if modern life is obviously contained from quiet work and does not include any physical actions, where young people could find adrenalin. As it seems to modern researches, the only variant is to show children in your own example that cruelty is not the unique variant of achieving their goals, moreover, in the most cases it leads to imprisonment or even death.
The other side of the problem is the prejudice against young people, when the attitude to them is negative without any previous foundation. Unfortunately, such an attitude causes real problems for the young people, who began to believe that they can not be good ore they do not need to be such people, because others would not believe them in any cases. Such discrimination is popular in the western countries, especially in Northern America and Europe against the black and Mexican citizens. Teachers and parents should grow tolerance in the growing generation, if people literally want to live in the next several years. Nowadays, we are standing on the border of the third World War, which is shown greatly by figures of crimes, where the young are participated.
To sum up, it should be said that this problem definitely significant and actual in our modern society and every government, teacher, parent and just person should as much as he can to solve it, because it leads us to a really dystopia.",7

Historically came, that artists always have been restricted by government or reach people. They lived poor and died poor, only after they died became famous and reach. For example todays well known Leonardo Davinchi restricted by the king of Italy. 
First of all, it is obvious that if government gives money and freedom to the artists, we will have many creative pictures and musics, which will improve the people power of mind. It would be beautifull country , where freedom of creative artists woulkd be allowed. It can be imagined beautifull buikdings, creative pictures everywhere. It woulkd be amazing. 
On the other hand,  many of artists is insane so if government gives them freedom, it would be very dangerous for our mind. For example, some insane artists want to draw the nude women on the buildings. This picture would be reasoning of some injury on the mind of the children.

In my opinion, government must find a new faster transport for turism, when people can use it, number of people, who want use airplanes will decrease. I agree with opinion in this task, but I think that this problem can not solve only with new laws. Government must give some money for improve our engineer technologes. They could decrease danger and damage for our planet. It was on the one hand. But on the other hand people from our planet must conside the most nearest places from their home. In this situation they could travel by train or bus for example.  If government introduce this laws, they will must decrease number of traveler, it will not good for our tourism. People will not happy, because their travel will be limited. In my conclusion I can say, that the better way in this situation is to improve our engineeria.

There are several reasons for that. First, English language has become the global language, making movies produced by the UK and the USA the most popular. Secondly, movies shot in these two countries usually have big investors, therefore making it possible to produce better quality pictures to attract the lovers of good movies. Thirdly, some of the local producers are not known outside of the area where they work, so people don't think it will later be possible for them to keep a conversation or discussion on the topic of cinema with someone from other country.
Governments all over the world have always invested money to produce films that would reflect certain ideology. In my opinion, it's right that authorities support producers monetary, but they shouldn't tell them what to shoot and what topic should the movie have. First of all, by giving money away government inspires young producers to come up with the idea of a movie that later might become popular. Second of all, as we have seen in Russia with the few governmentally supported films, movies that get funding from the state normally draw bigger attention. Lastly, movies as a form of art has always been used to document certain cultural differences that people have in particular country and that is why it is essential that goverment spends money on making note of these traits of character or historical events that are relevant to local community.
Overall, I think that it is correct for governments to support financially local film producers, as it will make an alternative for British and the US movies that nowadays are too overrated. I should also point out the fact that today there are not enough quality films in Russian cinemas and local industries will benefit from having more money because it creates more jobs and requires getting good education.",7

When child is grown up, he or she need the education, and on the West almost every education must be paid. The situation becomes more serious, if you have more than one baby. Cause of these reasons one parent just has not possibility to pay everything by himself or herself. To solve this problem parents usually try to find a good nanny, who can seat with child or children while parents are at home. But the logic is very simple: if you stayed child with nanny, he or she would be chanding. In our country the idea of nannys is not very popular.

In the first order, violence. A lot of video games challenges nowadays require to kill, thieve, rob and so forth. As kids become used to the violence  on a computer screen, they easily bring it into the real life as well.
The other cause of this effect concerns violence on the TV screen. However, I consider it to be less powerful than the computer games case, as, in contrast with the TV, kids commit vigilant crimes in the video game themselves. Nevertheless, the TV plays a huge role in making kids used to the violence, that is why they do not see it as a bad feature.
The most important thing parents and teachers should do, in my view, is to encourage people (especially kids) to play good games and watch worthy films. In the modern society, parents rarely supervise what their kids do and do not watch, and what entertains them.
By creating a kind and friendly environment by teaching kids to search for good games and TV shows, parents and teachers may encourage young people to reject playing violent games and watching films involving vigilant activities, in favor of games and films that develop a good sense of humour and appeal our sensibility.
To sum up, I would say that as long as the violence remains the same on a computer and TV screen, it would remain the same in life. As soon as we discourage it there, the real-life crime rate among young people will start dropping.

In my opinion, we face an increasing number of crimes committed by the youth due to lack of communication between parents and their children and the increasing popularity of online social networks. I believe only more effort to cooperate and communicate with young people can be a way to solve the problem.
Nowadays, the problem is that parents lack interpersonal communication with their children. Families spend less and less time together and that is the reason why young people may fail to obtain valuable moral principles and learn to understand the difference between “good” and “bad”. Moreover, the youth tend to spend more time communicating online, where it is much easier to face an example of abnormal behavior and violance. Lack of interaction in real life is substituted with more online communication and this may lead to gaining social norms which are represented in the Internet. But nowadays, there is not control after online social norms, which implies that their quality is quite unpredictable and usually, in fact, quite low.
As a lack of communication is the reason for quite low moral principles of the young, I believe only more interpersonal relations in real life can make a difference. Schools and parents should do their best to communicate more with the young. More cooperation will allow adults to chare their principles with the young and help them to avoid adopting abnormal behavior which they may face online or even in real life. However, it’s important not to restrict the young from using any sources of communication which may seem harmful. It is much more effective to educate young adults why some models of behavior may be impropper.
All in all, I believe, the key reason of the increased number of crimes, committed by young people is lack of real-life interaction whcih leads which leads to low social norms that young people adopt. The main remedy from that is more effort to cooperate with the young and let them know what the “good” and proper behavior is.

What I mean is art can not be associated with insulting others, making harm to others even if the Creator suppose it is how He sees the world. For example, a famous singer is writing a rude song about his enemy or a person he just dislikes. As soon as the people hear this song, they will have prejudices against this person without even knowing him/her.
Moreover, sometimes so-called art can have some inappropriate content, it can be inappropriate for children, for instance. This is when the government can interfere and put some age restrictions.

I am agree with the statemant 'we need to understand why is this happening and make something to change the situation. First of all, we all should agree that our century have many differences with oth other, but one of the most important ones is technology level. Today, a lot of young people play violent computer games, watch films about drugs and alchogol. This misslead teenagers and they do wrong things. To prevent it parents just need to spend more timy with their kids and, using the teacher' help, educate them what is good and what is bad. The second reason for this is that young people are still punished by their parents, and the modern life gives them more opportunity to make a crime (easier to find a gun, less risk of being killed). The edvice for parents is the same - they need  to think carefully about their children.
On the other hand, the modern society gives to teenagers more opportunities to educate themselfes. This should not lead to any bad concequances, how many says. They argue that technology make life easier. Also, they think that modern opportunity, which many countries give, such that hot water, heaters, electricity should make everyone, including parents, feel free to live their lifes and have less stress, so do less crimes or make bad thing for kids (to make them do crime).

Whilst some people argue that being caugh with using doping means exclusion from the sport field forever, other more loyal group reckon that 2 years of ban would be enough. Both views will be discussed in this essay.
Firstly, it must be tacken into account that we are talking about unfair crime. For everyone in sport industry their results are a kind of sence of their lives. So why should someone do their best, working really hard suffer of unfairness? Whilst those, who are using doping, are more working in chemistry field, than in sport. Though this perspective it is more satisfective to ban sportsmen, using illegal drugs, till the end if their lives.
Nevertheless, who is sinsless? Everyone is making mistakes throug a long life period. It doesn't mean that after one mistake a man must be excluded from a society. Moreover, when we are talking about sport, we should not put a ban forever, because it is about human nature to use all the methods to achieve the goal. From this perspective, we can agree that banning for 2 years is enough for a sportsman to analyse mistakes and become more successful in fair sports.
From my own perspective, professional sport is about being superhuman. All the results, shown on Olympic games, seems fantastic. That is why, it is incredibly unfair and cruel to use any doping, while someone is killing himself on trainings. Ban is a good way but not perfect. It seems to me that, firstly, we shouldn not prevent people from sport forever after one mistake, but using doping twise must lead to forever ban.
Secondly, I suppose it would be fair to discharge some points from a country, whose sportsman is using doping. In this way, it would become more fair and other sportsmen won't rist in using illegal drugs.
To sum up, I would like to say that although ban is a good way of punishment, it must not be a forever one after one mistake. Moreover impose punishment like discharging points on all country would work more efficiently. Everyone in a country commant should be responsible for this crime.

A lot of tecnologies such as concentrated food and video conversations were firstly developed for space exploration and nowadays they are used everywere. Consequently, a lot of modern vays of communication became possible only when scientist invented the artificial satelites. For instance, the GPS-navigation became possible only when all this satelites were sent into the space.

With the developpement of space exploration humans have send a lot of junk in the space.

So government should explain companies related to transportation in the air, that they have to decline everyday flights. Secondly, reducing the number of travelling by air-transport can help to short crushes that happens so often today.
However, people believe that it is very important to save the number of air-flights and government and states do not need to have a deal with air companies. Firstly, it is so comfortable for people to take a flight, whenever they need it. For example, if a person is a businessman, he can be in need to be in 3 hours in the other place of the world. That’s why he must have an opportunity get a flight currently. Secondly, many people state that there is no damage from air-transport for our nature.

The fact is factories works all days and all  night and they are bigger than planes, that is why they are more dangerous. Thirdly, the number of cars, which are polluting the world every day, are increasing day by day, so air travel is influencing global warming less than cars, that are everywhere.
In addition, I believe that governments should not take part in air travel.

Some humans believe that sportsmen using such drugs must be abandoned from professional competitions for some restricted period of time. However, other people offer to ban athletes forever.
Turning to the first point of view, it must be said that everyone can make a mistake, so it is rather fair to limit period without contests not for a long time. First of all, there are some cases when caught sportsmen even do not know about illegal drugs in their products: food and drink. It may be the opponent who cheated athlete and then told jury about it. If it is a well-organised crime, nobody will catch the criminal and instead of him this sportsman will be blamed. Such precedents are mostly widespread in big competitions such as Olympic games. Secondly, athlete may use illegal drugs if he is not ready to contests. Hence, it is important to remove him from competition and give him certain time, a year or some years, to keep himself in fit and compete with other candidates, without dopping.
However, some sport fans and organisators take care of the culture of sport with incredible love and tenderness. Consequently, for such people the usage of illegal drugs is the worst crime which deserves the strongest measures, because sportsmen who commit the crime, understand what they do: all depends on fortune. Nonetheless, athletes who do not respect sport and its principles cannot be called as sportsmen. 
To sum up, I want to say that despite the existence of these two radical opinions, I firmly adhere to the first one. I understand people who use illegal drugs, though I do not appreciate it: undoubtedly, sportsmen have a panic before the contests, they have to represent the whole country and all these factors lead to dopping in the final stage. Nevertheless, it is not the worthy reason to betray sport rules.

That is why nowadays using planes is very popular way of travelling for everyone. but the issue of air travel is very controversial, because planes contribute greatly to air pollution.

First of all, the most important benefit of air travel is reducing the time, which had been just wasted some decades ago. for example, it took weeks or even months to move to another continents, but now the same way takes only few hours. It is especially significant for businessmen, whose slogan is 'the time is the money'.

However, planes affect on the enviroment and leads to air pollution and global warming. The environmental damage is confirmed to be a danger for all human population. Nevertheless as for me, introducing laws limiting air travel for business or leisure has more cons then pros. fistly, it will be decreasing the pace of technical process and globalisation. Secondly, it may lead to corruption in the country because people will decide to buy the opportunity to travel by air unofficial.

In conclusion, I would like to say that air travel has become an essential part of modern world, and we cannon restrict it. Nevertheless, the problem of air pollution can be solved by developing of eco-technologies using governments' money as well as trans-national companies' money.

It’s not a big surprise that some people are richer that others, and, as a result, in every country there are citizens who experience the consequences of economic diversity every day. A “Guaranteed Basic Income” system which provides a stable sum of money every month can become a solution to this problem. But is the best option for country’s economy? Let us find it out.
To begin with, a “Guaranteed Basic Income” can become a breath of fresh air for poor people who don’t have enough money to buy even basic products for their survival. For example, it may help single poor mothers who don’t get any economic support from their ex-husbands to bring up their children, pay for food and education and provide them with everything they need. What is more, this guaranteed sum of money may greatly support people who experience slight, not constant problems with their income. For example, it will be useful for people who suddenly lost their job and need some time and money before they find a new place to work in.
On the other hand, this system has some significant disadvantages which may lead to huge economic problems. Firstly, some citizens will definitely use this guaranteed sum of money as their basic income. As a result, there will be less people who want to find a job and country’s economy will definitely suffer from that decrease in the number of employers. Secondly, this system may even lead to increase in the level of poorness as people won’t have motivation to work. For example, there are some citizens who don’t want to work anywhere because they already receive income from governments and don’t have a desire to get extra money.
All in all, I believe that governments and political parties should pay attention to both advantages and disadvantages of this system before using it in the economy of any country in the world. In my opinion, this system may help poor people, but at the same time destroy economic prosperity.",7

Overall, I agree with this opinion, because I believe in it. The creative artists must be given the freedom to express their good ideas.


The first hight that needs  to be said is the majority of people  think that creative artists must have big talant and they have created ideas. Therefore they made wonderful pictures, fantastic music and great film, say beautiful phrases and words. The beautiful and creative things made good mood and people  become happy.

I think that the global warming and air pollution are a big problem and we should do everything to solve this problem. I knew that there are many companies in the world searching ways to solve the problem.

I absolutely disagree with this statement. In my essay I will talk about different points of view surrounding that issue. I cannot follow the idea of reducing of air travels. Firstly, a lots of business processes depend on flights and some of them will not function as fast as they could be in case of reducing of air travels. Such situations may lead to economic and financial disoursters which are likely to be more dangerous for population. For instance, in case of unusual situation on stock market top management of investment banks will not be able to come to emergency conference very fast, what can have an awful consequences. Some people claim that such important percons can travel by car on blocked highways with traffic jams. Nevertheless, there is no transport faster than a jet. Secondly, these protectors of humanity should recall the fact that jets are the most safety transport that people have ever made. For instance, in countries with a small amount of flight people use other transport and because of that the statistics of depth during the traveling is worse then in other countries. It means that measures of reducing flight will not have a positive impact as it is supposed to have. At conclusion I would say that in contemporary world people need to have a lots of air travel as they develop very fast and the most fastest way of traveling must be exist.

Nowadays, some believe that the prolonged sentence of a prisoner will be a good idea of punishment, while others disagree. In my opinion, the periods of sentence should be discussed to avoid negative effects of the punishment. The reasons for that will be outlined below.    To begin with one should take into account that the longer prison sentence has a beneficial effect on the sentenced. On the one hand, their attitude of the prisoners can be dramatically changed by  their reflection during the period of sentence. As it appears to be not each of the sentenced  is  able to recover after the punishment; moreover, he or she can return to the dangerous activity from the part. As for the society, a longer period of sentence cannot put pressure on them; therefore, victims and their relatives can apply for a psychological help during the period of sentence without thinking over the revenge. However, this solution shows a range of disadvantages for the prisoners. On the one hand, their social detachment may cause further depression; on the other hand, they may not definitely bear and survive strict prison conditions. To consider the other view point one should think over the less problematic solutions for the crime reduction. Though the trainings and rehabs may be considered less effective, these ways of punishment can change the attitude of the prisoners. Instead of prolonging the punishment, one can introduce more educational assessments and trainings to be sure that the prisoner will tend to normal life in future.  In my opinion, strict measures can have a devastating effect on human mind, namely, a longer sentence can damage social nets in the society. As everyone has a chance to recover and stick to a normal life, there should be introduced trainings and recover organizations.   To conclude, a longer prison sentence can cause negative effects in the society. Once introduced, they can destroy personality of the prisoner; however, the sentenced people can be saved and educated.     ",7

One of the most agreed-upon possible solutions to this problem comes from space travel and space colonization. However, as always, there is a huge debate on whether this problem is urgent enough or should our government instead spent its money on more pressing isssues, like poverty and world pollution.
As for me, I firmly believe that space exploration is deeply benefitial to our society and should not be swept under the carpet in favor of working on other problems of modern society. The first argument in favor of that, in my opinion, is that with space travel comes an age of technical advancement, which, in turn, causes some issues to become more managable. Secondly, with the colonization of other planets, the number of opportunities for making money should skyrocket. It is even possible that a lot of civilians, as opposed to scientists, will find new ways of doing some things or even make a major discovery, thus causing their names to be forever remembered. Moreover, space travel is a fairly recent dream, while such problems as poverty were already experiensed for as long as thousands of years into the past. With that in mind, why should we even pay so much attention to these problems, if they have long proved themselves to be unsolvable?
Overall, I can certainlly see why some people and even politicians consider space exploration a waste of time and money, however, all things considered, such view is extremely near-sighted and can cause a great number of problems in the long run.",7

Of course, that is an important thing to worry about because, unfortunately, global problems are becoming more and more actual for modern society. However, is it fair to put the blame on this kind of means of transport?
Personally, I strongly believe that life in 21st century without planes and so on is absolutely impossible. Firstly, everyday routine requires the possibility to get to some other countries and even continents in hours. To be honest, the technologies are not progressive enough to create a faster way to move around the world. People who obtain important posts just have no alternative but jet or plane if they have to get to, for example, the USA from Russia.
Secondly, other means of transport like cars, trains, ships also keep on having huge influence on our nature. The gas from cars pollutes roads, forest and other places people go, the need to build railways makes workers destroy already mentioned forests, change rivers' direction. There is no way of creating facilities for transport which can be totally safe for the planet.
Last but not least, the most dangerous enemy of the world is humans. All the places that we discover become comfortable for our relaxation, having fun or even working but extremely impossible for trees to grow, for animals to breed and for natural complexes to exist. We do not think about how the planet is going to survive our invasion and forget that we make it only worse that way for ourselves.

To make a conclusion, it is pretty important to understand that technologies are not going to stop its development because we have already got used to such speed of life. Scientists should do all their best to invent maximally exological means of air transport, cars, etc. All we can do is to try to respect the resources of our planet and take care about the word we think we own.",7

A lot of talanted people loose there money, because it’s easy for everybody to find the new film or song in the internet instead of buying it.

I agree with the opinion that people making free pirate copies must be judged. Money that must be payed for masterpieces of talanted musicians, actors, producers are the salary for them. If there is no salary it’s better for a person to change his job just to get some money. In 90th a lot of young musicians stopped their repetitions and concerts because of terrible lack of money. Now nobody knows about there great talent. So, we have the risk of repeating. Secondly, the process of creating new movie or a song is not so cheap like it seems to be. Producers waste a lot of money in order to get more after the first night. And what to do if you can’t get your money back? Also the quality of shared copies is always not so good. Allfilms and music are firstly made the audience to enjoy it. Bad quality can turn all the pleasure you could got into nothing.

But there is also a lot of people who thinks in another way. For them shared internet copies is an ordinary thing which can make our life easier. They are sure that the easier access to culture can make it more popular between young people. Also they say that you never know if the song or a film is good, may be it’s not worth paying. For example, there can be a situation when you don’t like the movie, but you’ve already payed for a ticket to the cinema and it harder to leave it. Moreover a lot of people who can’t pay for a disc with music or a ticket to the cinema free internet copies become a great opportunity to get into culture and to be in trend.

Finally, I can say that in both extents there are pros and cons, but only government can choose to stop pirate copying and sharing or not to stop.

Some people claim that usage of illegal drugs has to be punished for a fixed period of time, while others tend to think that a dishonest athlete has no right to compete without any time limints. In this essay both views will be examined carefully.
First of all, usage of illegal drugs is not a crime and sometimes is not even a choice. Some medicaments that treat certain diseases simply coincide with those that are illegal. An athlete may not have been aware of this fact. In such cases a ban from professional competing for a year or two seems to be acceptable. One should also keep in mind that this is not a serious crime and not letting to compete forever might be a too severe punishment. As long as an athlete can prove that not all of his/her achievements depend on using illegal drugs, he/she must not be punished forever.
On the other hand, dishonesty in competition provokes many controvercies. The honour of an athlete cannot be overestimated, since it takes origin from the Ancient Olympic times. This is a solid ground of a professional competition. Provided that every participant sweared to compete honestly, the everlasting ban does not seem to be an unfair punishment. It also has to be mentioned that such restrictment concerns only a professional career of a sportsmen, it does not cover amateur sphere, so the sport and even some sort of competition remains available for an athlete.
To conclude, I would like to state that while usage of illegal drugs concernes serious ethic and moral aspects, such as honour and honesty, it is crucial to remember that each case has its special conditions and punishment should go in conjunction with all of them. In spite of this there are other people who claim that dishonest competition has no excuses and has to be punished forever.

However, the system of Koyoto and Los Angeles are really short. Moreover, the underground railway system of Tokyo is the busiest one because 1927 million of passengers visit it every year. The metro in Paris has a high rate of passengers per year too. On the contrary, Koyoto and Los Angeles subway systems are modern and not so popular to use: 45 and 50 million of passengers each year.

For example, only about 10% of women decided to take skilled vocational diploma, while more than 80% of men did so. Another areas with the higher percentage of males are postgraduate diploma and master's degree, 70% and 60% respectively. Nevertheless, women were more appealed to have undergraduate diploma, as the number of them made up 70%. In comparison, the amount of men was only half of that.


To summarize, it is obvious that men were more involved in higher education than women. Although there were some types of degrees that interested females more, the overall trend is reverse. We can see clearly that the amount of males in almost any other area was double as the females' one.

Many great discoveries were made, but are they so great that they mean more than unsolved issues on Earth? I tend to agree with the opinion that money spent on space exploration can be more useful on Earth.
First of all, poverty is still a very big issue in lots of countries. There a still places where average income is about 15 dollars a month, whereas one spaceship start (not always a fortunate one) costs billions of dollars.
There are many other problems in the world which can be solved with money. For example, some enviromental issues, such as pollution. In China this is a very big problem. There are a lot of cities with more than a million of people, this means that there are huge numbers of cars on a small territory. This led to constant smoge on the streets which led to that almost every citizen has problems with their lungs. Although, there are solutions. For example, Singapoore builds high-tech systems to grow as many plants on their territory as they can. This is a city which is also a country, there are not much space, so they decided to use rooftops, balconies, even walls as places where trees and other oxygen makers can grow.
On the other hand, space exploration gives us knowledge of some fundamental laws which will help to live a better life. Some people even say that someday everyone will just leave this planet and everything will get better.

Many people think the best way to increase crime is to give longer prison sentences. From my point of view, it is not a great idea. If person have courage to do some wrong ations he\she do it. Poople who think about crime know that they will be punishment. And for them there is no difference how mach time they will spend in the prison.

I totally disagree with this opinion. To my mind such politics are almost an instant crash course to the whole country. Despite I do not have a degree in economics or in relatable field, I will try my best to explain my disagreement.

To begin with, growing all consumable food inside the country brings up a threat of global starvation for all country residents due to bad harvests and/or cataclysms, and importing as little as possible will be a tough strike to state’s economy that will most likely result in decline of quality of life throughout the country. 

Secondly, not all countries have enogh fertile farm lands to produce enough food to all their population, and alternative methods of producing food are not as effective. Also, a lot of countries have imperfect climate for all sorts of food to grow, and some consist mostly of deserts, which makes said strategy at least questionable.

At last, even if all countries will manage to keep this policy, a lot of consumer food products become unavailable to most of people, and it may have some serious impact in the life of most people.

To conclude, the policy, stated in the beginning will have a devastating impact on any country, that decides to implement it, and only the healthy proportions of internal production and import can lead to stability and prosperity.

First and foremost, rooting for your favorite team can result in violence. A lot of sports fans feel so involved with the game that if their favorite team gets knocked out, it aggravates them so much that they cause disturbance to other people. The prime example would be the numerous fan fights that occured during the World Cup.
Secondly, being just a fan and not actually doing sports is a waste of time. Instead of sitting on the couch and whining about how the players perform, it would more beneficial to your health, both mental and physical, to go out and excersise. For instance, it has been proven by various studies that most sports fans don't work out themselves.
But nevertheless, some people claim that being a sports fans and rooting for your country during world championships bring the country together. But I believe that this is not true as most of the time it only fosters animocity between countries.

Through the expectations there will be growth in percentage op people in the age of 15-59 years. But numbers of people aged 60 and more years will jump to 42,3 percent. Percentage of children under 14 will not show so sharp increase, and will become smaller by 2,8 per cent than in 2000.

Being artists is too hard because they have many problem when try to write masterpiece. Sometimes this problem is connected with their wish, sometimes with place of dream, because they can not find it, or with government restrictions, so they can not draw all they want.
Government restrictions are one of the bad reasons why artists can not create anything. He should work in freedom in place of his dream and wish, and after that he can create masterpiece that will be famous and popular. Also, after creating new picture, by artist it can be forget, because it can have some elements that government restrict. Besides, if there is new restriction, than the picture that is famous can be destroyed.
T the other side of this problem, government restrictions should be on the way of drawing new picture, because it is our future and to change some thing of opinion about masterpiece, all can changed. People should remember about changing in the past and how it is now. Also some creative artists can create amoral picture, so government should restrict it.
However with government restrictions create some new pictures, that can be famous and popular is too hard for artists, but it should exist because another way of drawing evolution can destroy modern art and future world.

There is an opinion that planes rise the level of pollution and contribute global warming. Some people think that to solve this problem gevernment should decrease the amount of not essential travels for business and rest. Other people consider it too strict. 
There are several reasons why such measure should not be taken. First of all, most people travel by plane because they want to go to another country and there is no other opportunity to get there by another way. However, such flights might be unpopular and as a result unnecessary for the society in general, for example if it is not a season for going in this country. But those people just probably cannot have a vocation in another part of the year. That is why if a government prohbits these travels, it will be unfair in attribute to such people as everyone has a right to travel. 
As for business, using a plane might be the only way of transportation goods, for instance, as well. In this case a businessman just cannot cancel it. Although, there are some things which could be done to improve the situation. Government could suggest some other more efficient ways of transportation. For example, if there is a little number of things which should be delivered, they could be sent to place where there is enough number of them and after that they all could be transported by a plane.
To sum up, governments should not prohibit by car travels which seem to be unnecessary. However, they could think of how to make such travels less harmful for the environment.

Another problem is that children and young people can loose their eye vision because they sit in front of TV, gadges and computers too. The solution of these two problems is very simple: people must go walk on the fresh air, do some sport and limited themselves of using gadges.

There are a lot of other problems, for example, people become more selfish, rude, their attention at surroundings would become lower but these problems are appears to personal and not cause any health problems.

For example, everyone knows shop named ""Zara"", each time people visit this place all around the world, they know what kind of clothes they are buying, it is on top of fashion, it made from beautiful materials and so on.

On the other hand, small local businesses pay many taxes, that is the base for country's economy and for its budget. That is the reason why government of the developed countries are trying to encourage appearance of small businesses. Moreover, such a business gives people the opportunity to decide on product, so in Moscow we have many shops of organic food, which do not connected to multinational brands and every time I am buying products for my family I can chose the most appropriate for me thing, that is a great idea.

Now, government want introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travels. I agree with it, because some air travels can provide to air pollution this ways of train should be laws, than now.
The first reason do it, is risk of global warming. This transport can damage our ecological situation and pollute our air. It’s lead on global warming, because it’s link with azone disbalanse on air. Now this problem is very actual. If we can stop the one reason damage out ecological area, we will can stop and other happens with some problem. Air pollution give us future risk a global warming and other ecological catastrofy. The second reason, this transport not always nessesary. There are too much people, who can chose other ways for their business traines. Some times with ways more quicly and comfortable, when traines on road way, for example, people don’t want waste their time and chose air travel on short travel. This reason is not so good, because our business are not necessary, but after it can destroy our environment area. There are a lot of other ways to train. People can used a car for exaple. It’s not so big transport that’s why it’s more safety. For this reason, in conclusion, if goverments introduce laws to reduce the amount of air ways, it’s will be helpful for us and all the Earth. Unnecessary things, such as small business travels on airline, should go in the past. Laws distanse is not a reason for air travels. We need to chose the most safety thing for usaly use.

This sum will not depend on any other income you receive and will be the same for everyone. However, can advantages of this system outweigh the disadvantages?
In my opinion, such system has more disadvantages that advantages for two reasons. Firstly, this system will not lead to significant changes in lives of middle-class and upper-class. For example, people who earned a lot of money from elsewhere will continue to earn their money, but this system will just give them an additional income. Other people, who do not earn much money, will also have an additional income, but this will not change their position in the society. We can see that the situation will remain the same for ordinary people, but the rich will get richer. In addition to this argument, it is obvious that prices will grow with the introducing of this system, so it will not make people’s lives much better, but will just spend government’s money.
Secondly, this system can damage the interest in finding a job. If people earn money doing nothing, why should they work? This problem will definitely occur with this system. The level of unemployment will grow dramatically but the main problem will be that people will become too lazy to work and will not be willing to find a job. This will damage the economy.

Most people think that government should pay more attention on social problems rather then on building new space ships, while I am not agree with them.

Thus, during such expeditions we can learn something new not only about different planets, but also about our own home. Secondly, it improves the way how we live. We would not have such common things today like television or the Internet without space exploration. In the near futur we might have something new that will be absolutely irreplaceble.
Nevertheless, some people are quick to point out that trying to be the best in such field governments forget about real problems in their countries, for example, the level of life, crime, homeless people and other social problems.

Some people decree that governments should reduce the amount of air travel by introducing some specific laws. In my opinion, air travel greatly involves on globalization and there are so many other more damaging processes with problems that really should be solved.
With a rise of machinery throught globalization, there is a rise of some types of transport which can help to connect many countries for some government and business needs. Also, such transports like air transport male people closer and the distance shorter.
Consequantly, trips are easier now, it let us to go wherenever we want and desire.
Where are a lot of another problems that take more damage that air travel. Firstly, factories produce a lot of gases polluting the environment. Ot course, government already takes taxes from such companies, but from my point of view, it is not enough. Secondly, other vehicles like cars, buses really pollute air. Althought, there are a lot other doing like deforestation. So, the government should pay attention on this sides, because without air transportation it is complicated to connect between develop and developing countries.
Probably, I think that government should not reduce the amount of air travel for business, because they gain much money from that by selling and buying sometimes air transport can fly almost empty, without passaegers. It can be because of unsuitable weather for travel. Many tourists prefer just summer to go abroad.

This essay agrees that even the big anount of air travel should not be prohibited. However, both views will be considered.

To begin with, one convincing argument in favor of air travel is that this type of transport does not play a key role in evnironmental pollution. For example, the damage which is produced by the cars is even worse than the planes' influence. In addition, it is obvios that the number of business travels would not be reduced because of world globalisation. People need to go to other states to have an opportunity to make international work together. This confirms that air travel is better to be more popular than other transport, in case it is less harmful for nature and our planet.

On the contrary, there is another side to the issue. Global warming and air pollution (as well as water pollution) are international problems, which shoud be solved by all counties. And since air travel is one of the reasons of our planet's damage, some people claim that the most part of it should be canceled. This idea seems doubtful because it implies that communication between countries (and, later, international relations) would be more complicated.

To my mind, people need to find the way of how the air planes can be improved. Probably it is possible to reduce the damage, which is produced by flights. Nevertheless, air travel is not the only reason of air pollution or global warming. There are heavy industries and a lot of factories in almost every country of the world, which pollute nature and cause global warming too. So, in my opinion, there are many other problems to be solved.

To sum everything up, there are several measures which can be taken to protect nature. One of them is to make air flights even more popular, because they hurt our planet less than cars do. But I strongly believe that the amount of air travel should not be reduced, because this action will only make the international communication more complex, while environmental problems would not be solved.",7

Secondly, money put in this type of research helps scientists understand the processes that are taking place on Earth, which leads to progress that we all want to achieve. It is very important if we want to continue develop and gather knowledge about what is happening around us and, most importantly, why this is happening. Finally, space exploration gives people jobs and careers, as well as any other types of jobs.
Nevertheless, many people have different take on this topic. They think that cutting off money spent on space exploration means that they will be put on solving urgent problems, such as poverty, even though it is not how economy works. Also, they do not see the benefits that space science gives us on solving these environmental issues. However, it is clear that many data about the structure and changes of Earth come directly from work that is being done while researching the space.
Overall, evolution of humankind and solving the problems on Earth can only come hand in hand with the development of science, especially the exploration of space.",7

Originating from feminist studies and the equality of human rights, the idea of splitting university courses in equal male and female parts seems absurd to me. The same rules and demands, imposed on university applications, regardless of the candidate gender, already become a garantee towards fair university choices.

More than that, any university is highly interested in the most talented students, despite the student;s gender. In case university admits the «half and half» proportion for the subjects, it may restrict some gifted applicants from either side.

Next, there are subjects that considered to be traditionally feminine or masculine. For example, there is a clear feminine dominance in the sphere of children’s education: kindergardens and schools, whereas in the labour domains where physical force is required, the preference is given to men. Males and females are different physically and phycologically, thus they suit better for different occupations.

Needless to say that males and females have different social roles as well. The university subjects requires corresponding climate and artificial division in halves won’t serve to the best of the atmosphere. It’s much more interesting to study with people who are encouraged and curious about the subject than with ones that were taken the form the equal proportion.

To sum up, I would like to say that history knows many examples of outstanding scientists of both genders. For the university, the prime concern should be on student’s motivation and eagerness to develop, the gender doesn’t matter. However, the equal conditions of entry and fair competition of candidates is of high importance. The university courses should form naturally, not artificially in order to provide best productivity.

Eye diseases occure when people are using their electronic devices, especially if gadgets do not have eye-friendly screens or they are used close to eyes. Number o problems with overweigh rises because people became less active due to new technologies. For example, American scientists found out that every third American had problems with eyes in 2010, comparing to 15% in 1990. They said the main reason is the popularity of modern gadgets. Thus, modern technologies really can affect user’s health. 

However, these problems can be solved and many states now implement some of the possible solutions. Manufacturers contribute to this by creating new gadgets or software which will stimulate owners to some physical activities, as an example, popular game Pokemon Go allows players to level up only by doing some activities like walking or running. Possible solution for the problems with eyes is to develop new screens which will not be harmful. Governments can help with this by financing researches. That means that these problems can be solved or at least damage can be reduced.

I completely agree with those who are sure that governments have to take measures to shift to other means of travel when possible. Members of society often do not concerned about the role of air travel in air pollution so they have fights very frequently. If mass media warn the citizens about the consequences of air travel, people may make a shift to another mode of transport. Moreover, governments ought to introduce special laws and taxes on tickets, depending on the amount of carbon emissions produced. Raising the cost of air travel will defenetly have a significant impact on consumers furthermore, nowadays business trips are not as necessary as they were before modern tendances allow to communicate with a person from other side of the planet by Internet. Thus, firms can easily decrease the number of business travels of its employees. On the other hand, trains, cars, and ships also make harm to the environment. If all people will shift to these of travel, the volume of pollutive emission may even increase!

To prove this it is enough to remember about space race between USA and USSR during The Cold War in the 20th century. However, space exploration asks for a lot of money. Many people think that, probably, it would be better to spend this money for more everyday problems.
In my opinion, goverments should put urgent problems first and pay much more attention to them than to space exploration. First of all, goverments need to look after theis citizens, not after stars. They must build new roads, improve hospitals and educational system. If countries have money for spaceships but do not have good level of life, it is bad goverment. Stars are wonderful but millions people in the world live in poverty and cannot afford even their own home. Society problems should be solved before space exploration because spaceships and colonies on Mars would not be needed by anyone, if there are dying citizens who cannot affort healthcare.
Secondly, space exploration has no practical aim now. It is only science. It cannot improve or change life of counties. If so, why would goverment waste citizens' money for this? For example, International Space Station is a great project but it means nothing to everyday life. Some of money should be spent for space but only for support of science. At the same time it seems like for many countries space exploration is a question of death and life. This fact is weird because it does not solve problems and would not in many years.

Some people believe that all the content on the Internet should be free and avialible to everyone, while their opponents argue that illegal copying can be claimed as a theft or at least as a kind of crime.
Actually, the opinion that pirate copying should be punished is really widespread around the world. People who support that position usually provide three main arguments. Firstly, illegal copying affects the amount of money that people of art earn every day. It reduse their income so people become less motivated to work at the sphere of arts. Secondly, it is bad for the governments economies because the illegal spreading of that content cannot be taxated. Thirdly, these illegal actions can undermine the moral side of modern societies. It means that nowadays some people start to think that something “illegal” can sometimes be a good (or normal) thing. It happens because people face illegal spreading almost every day what makes it normal for them, therefore the governments want to stop pirate copying immediatly.
However, there is an opposite point of view on this issue. Some people think that every person in the world should be able to find all the content he or her needs for free. Advocates of this opinion say that some people just cannot afford buying films and music while they need it to increase their levels of culture and education.
In my opinion, every work should be rewarded so it is not fair that film producers, actors and musicians loose some part of their money because of pirate copies. However, I believe that all the educational movies and pieces of art should be free as it is important for the level of culture worldwide.

However, there are arguments on whether the sportsmen who were caught cheating this way should be banned from competing for the whole lives or just for some time. There are both advantages and disadvantages in those ways of dealing with this problem.
First of all, we should keep in mind that spotsmen, especially young ones, can be influenced by their coaches. That is why young athlets should be educated and taughted by their parents not to take any medications from others without talking to parents. Some people think that some people could have just made a huge mistake using illegal drugs but that mistake should not be crucial and should not destroy their careers. Moreover, come people claim that the drugs found in some sportsmens blood are not drugs, but just medications, which are necessary for those athlets health.
However, all those points are not easily checked and some people say those points cannot be used as an excuse for taking prohibited medications. I personally think that the athlets caught taking drugs should be excluded from the competition forever, but the key is to educate sporsmen more, especially in the field of sport law.

Firstly, if governement will spend all budget on the sports facilities then people have no choice to do. This is not the best way to encourage people to stand up from theirs computer tables, but in my opinion it will work. Some people, who live in the country far away from city center, can not allow to go to the swimming pool, for example, because in order to get there, they have much money in their pocket. In this way increasing number of sports facilities can help such people to be fit.
On the other hand, increasing the number of sports facilities is not enought because governement can not force people to go there, they should want to go themselves. Moreover, small number of sports facilities is not only reason of low public health. Air, water pollution, bad food and stress can damage person`s health. For example, a lot of people go away from megapolices to claim countries because they can not hear this permanent noisy of thousands of cars, plans and fans. It is a large stress for everybody.

To sum up the all above, I can say that building new sports facilities is well idea, but governement should concern not only about body health, but mental health. Also it is not enought to create possibilities for people who do not allow this but to encourage them to go to the jim.

There is an opinion that the number of flights should be reduced to prevent environment from pollution. I believe that people should care of this pollution, but not by prohibition of flights, but due to technological progress. The airplanes are very common mean of transport and they are important for business, as there are a lot of places, where people can reach only by the air, e.g. oil deposits in the Syberyia, so, governmnets can just prohibit buseness flights, as some urgen question need immediate considerations, and in such cases businessmen extremely need airplanes. So, it can be said, that such laws will surely cause problems for economy. What about flights for leisure, if government will try to prohibit them, it will face with a problem of identifying the purpose of flight. As people who can afford private jets are usually very affluent and busy, they can say that their flight is on current business affairs, and governments will have to devote a plenty of resources to control this issue and decide whether to prohibit the flight or not. The problem can be solved by reducing taxes for aircompanies and business men who use ecological jets. New models of planes, such as Boeing 787, or Airbus 850 are constructed with the main idea of keeping the environment clean, thee planes almost do not pollute atmosphere, they are very ecological, and if more airlines will use them, there will be no danger for our planet form air transport. Low taxes for companies flying on such jets will faster demand for them and only such planes will be designed and produced in near future. In conclusion, the problem of global warming from pollution is real and people do have to cope with it, but not by imposing such measures as they would not bring any benefits to industry and human society for whom the air travel is very important.

Considering any form of art a way to speak about something hardly anyone can make any restrictions without breaking the essential human rights. Meanwhile I think it is necessary to give all the freedom to any artist, it still seems fair to me that piece of art can somehow hurt other people, so the government restrictions can be used only for protection but not for limiting one's will to express himself.
Due to the fact that contemporary art is developing and becoming more and more extraodinary, some people can say that the government should restrict such perfomance that can somehow hurt feeling of other people. The scandalous organisation ""Pussy Riot"", which had punk pray in the cathedral, is still being discussed. All the people are divided into two fighting groups; one is proclaiming that this perfomance is a form of modern art aimed to express the political protest, and another group is sure that the punk pray is nothing but only an attempt to hurt the feelings off religious people and descrinate the faith. However, freedom of people to express their own is a constitutionally proclaimed right of everyone so no one can be deprived of it. More to say, throughout the centuries all the artists (musicians, painters, poets) have struggled for their freedom to be heard.
Therefore, it seems to me like it is not the government who can somehow restrict the artists' freedom to express themselves. The only rules that can somehow be excercised must be created only by the common will of society, so these rules will become some moral orientiers for artists in order to make it more easy to distinguish where the expression of themselves can hurt anyone else.

One of them is should male and female students work together and even more - in equal numbers. Some people lelieve that it's inappropriate , to make universities accept equal numbers of male/female students, others agree that it will improve current situation in education. 
There exist strong arguments of both sides of this disscussion, which implies that it is worth examining all points of view before reaching any conclusion. 
First of all, there is a necesity to say that one of the advantages of these type of accepting students is the equallity between men and women. Equall numbers mean equall opportunities for people, without discrimination sexes. Moreover, there is a plenty of scientist's researchs convincing that working between male and female groups of people in equall proportions gives a much more favor. Also, this type of proportion helps members of each group interact with others easily, that when there is a disproportion.
Another point of view is that such type of accepting students is useless and pointless. Supporters claim that such thing can destroy the real competition between students, which is based on knowledge, not on female / male you are or not.
Another drawback of equall accepting numbers is that it can crushed all system of university's academic freedom - government will give concrete numbers of students , who schould study in universities. And one of the most convincing arguments againts equall proportions between male/female students is that there is no any correlation or connection between knowledge and which sex do you have. And I am firmly believe in that. Since the Medievel times, people fight against discrimination, for modern society with equall rights for everybody. And for the first time, this meosure for accepting equall numbers of students seems like justice, lut it is not real suitable criteria for competition between students. There is no shame if men are good at law and women in teaching as there is no any discrimination between them in case of disproportion.
Considering all arguments , it can be concluded that the idea of universities accepting equal number of male / female students is not good of all.

There is no doubt that freedom helps thoughts to fly. But I do not think  that this freedom should not be restricted, because everything has nits own limits. Iv the artist feels free, it doese not mean that there qare no things and actions that are prohibited. Moreover, such thoughts may be dangerous as for a person, who shares this idea, as for people around him or her. For example, there is one russian actor, who has already showed distructive behaviour. He also has injured some people. Giving people an action freedom is too dangerous for society. It is also kniwn that some artists begin to take drugs hen they have a crisis. Who can predict whatnwill happen around them while they being affected? Nobody knows. 
From my point of view, being restricted by somebody or something is the way of becoming better as an artist. If you can create something while being in an empty room, you are a genius. It does not matter who restricts you, but if you can bring your masterpiece to the diamond despite all the difficulties it means you wil improve your skills during the whole life. 
Creating something is a difficult way to understand who you are and what you can do. Feeling free helps to identify your personality but we should not forget that sometimes it can be very dangerous foir thise who surround us. Do not avoid restrictins that is the key to success.

While the idea of such a system suggests nothing but positive effects on citizens, there can be a few not as obvious drawbacks that are worth being mentioned.
It goes without any doubt that the system can have a positive influence on people and the whole society itself. I will take under consideration a few of them which seem to be the most significant to me. Firstly, it could provide citizens with a chance to start saving money for things they were not able to afford before. For instance, college for their children, a new house or their own business. Secondly, as this system represents a guaranteed source of income, people will not be afraid to quit the job they do not like in order to find a new one or move to another city and start a new life.
At the same time, there are some disadvantages to be listed as well. In my opinion, this idea sounds good in theory, but not in practice. Where do politicians plan to get money from? The only answer I can come up with is them rising taxes. And if it will be this way, what is the point in introducing the idea? What is more, it could be assumed that many people might want to leave their job as they will be satisfied with the amount of money they will be provided.

People travel abroad not only for marking the places they have been or for looking the sightseeings they can’t see at home but to taste some traditional food in the country that they are visiting. For example, many people visit France not only to visit Eifel tower but to taste frog legs or green cheese.

So why we can’t afford this delicious food in Russia? Because the cooking recipe of this dilicies is the national secret that keeps tourist’s interests hot to this country.

However, there is another option why traditional food can’t go abroad. We know that Asian countries are famous for their extraordinary spicy dishes. Roasted insects, heavily hot spicy chicken wings and other strange looking stuff makes tourists to decline to taste the national cookings of Asia. From my experence, only the bravest ones tried the dishes, and less liked it. As a result nobody wants to import Asian food to their homeworld, despite that Asian people don’t need any other type of food, so they are happy with all they have eating it with sticks.

To sum up, we can see that the world trends are messing up because of national mixings. More people are going to live abroad, more families are creating form different coultures. in that case I can’t agree that food isolation in the country is nescessary. Our world slowly becomes as one, the traditions are barely thrown in the past.

Some people believe that a lot of travelling is unnecessary and the number of travel for business and leisure should be reduced by the government. Personally I do not suppose that it can be possible and in this essay it will be discussed why.

First of all banning some kinds of travelling and decreasing the number of flights can lead to many personal problems between people. This law can destroy a lot of private plans which are essential for somebody. For example, a woman has not seen her children who live in another country for many years because of the work. She finally has time now to visit them but there is not any flight and in addition she will not have an opportunity to do this later.

Certainly, such kind of personal situation is a drop in an ocean of problems which can be brought by air pollution and global warming. So I would recommend to reduce the amount of air travel until scientists wouldn't have invented some ecological alternative mean of air transport.

In conclusion, it is recommended to solve the problem of air pollution and global warming by inventing some ways to use an ecological transport but not reducing the amount of air travel. Because people, in general, will not be satisfied when some laws destroys their personal important plans. Moreover people would not enjoy their life without traveling and learning unfamiliar culture which also means a lot for international communications.

On the one hand it is evident why this opinion appeared. People who support it think that, fistly, the longer the prison sentence is, the more people fear to get into prison, and secondly, there will be less criminals on the streets, as most of them will be in prisons for long (or forever).

On the other hand increasing the length of prison sentences has some disadvantages.To begin with,'longer' compaired to what standard? Every country has its own, and those countries which have the longest prison sentences do not suffer least from the crimes. After that, where to keep all the criminals, what would they eat? Of course, taxes rise automatically, which will lead to a wave of protest in the society. Then, a criminal society is formed in prisons, the longer one stays there, the more of a criminal one becomes. Let us take an example of a crime story, a boy decided to record a movie in the cinema and post it on the internet. After the reform, which makes ALL the prison sentences longer, he might remain in prison not for a couple of years, but for the whole decade. What kind of a person is he going to be after going out? If we increase the penalties only for certain crimes, then how should we choose which ones? So, we can see, that there is a lot to think through in this law.

It should be stated that there are other ways to reduce crimes. I believe, that the government could make all the prisoners work and thus make prisons profitable. Doing so will not only give some money to the governmental budget, but also give criminals a profession. There may even be a practice of giving the former prisoners work on the factories.

To sum up, prison sentences should be increased with caution, moreover, in my opinion, other measures should better be taken to reduce crime.",7

On the one hand, it can be a good idea to accept the similar number of male and female in one subject because it can be interesting for people to comunicate with each other. Moreover, these people can miss more lessons because when girls, for example, will have attention from boys, they will want to go to university more (this situation can happen with men too). In addition, a lot of people are single from philology faculty ir mathematic faculty, because they are always busy with their study in order to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend outside from ther university, but if there is the similar quantity of male and female on the one faculty or even on the one subject, these people can have a private life.
On the other hand, it can be really hard or even impossible for universities to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. For example, not a lot of man want to be a philologist, and there are a lot of girls at these types in this direction and only a few men. The same situation is with mathematics faculty (but here there is a lot of men) and university can’t obligate people to study on the faculty, where they won’t want to study.
To sum up, it can be said, that the idea to accept the similar quantity of  man and woman in every subject is good, but it is very hard to make it real.

The major issue, which is drastically changing our world, is that those crimes are often committed by youngsters. Nothing emerges from nothing, therefore there are certain causes of such a demeanor.

To my mind, one of the main things that cause teenagers to make dire mistakes of committing a crime is a lack or just bad parenting. Sometimes parents remain the main reason of child's wrong behavior. Thus, in my opinion, to solve a problem like this our government should make compulsory parenting courses for people who are thinking of starting a family. This decision should be well thought through and consciously made.
The second cause of young people committing crimes may be the absence of information of what follows after it. It would be great if teachers at schools could give students lectures concerning the punishment that the crime is followed by. Not only will it discourage students from doing something stupid, but also it will make them more educated in terms of law, which is a brilliant bonus.

Last but not least is the one that mainly affects the psychological aspect. Sometimes young people could act like this because of how little attention they are given. I suppose, that the solution would be for teachers and parents to support them and show that they are surrounded by people who love, need and care about them.

If the government, parents and teachers all together take action as soon as possible the situation may be slowed down or even stopped. Such issues that young people are involved in should always be raised and solved fast as long as it is not that dramatic.",7

Let`s consider this question for all sides. Suppose that the number of sports facilities was increased. But how will we know that people are interesting it? It is can do if make survey people and know thir interests. 
Example: ask children that is their like sport play. And after analysis answers will build sport area for this play. also we can ask other people and increase quantity of sport areas. I think tat it should improve public health.
On other hand many people do not want to engage sport, and like just sit at home. To solve this problem we should make motivation for those people. We should advate sport and sport activity or equpment. Example: boots and clothes for morning running. If people will see on display their TV such, ads they will think that healthy life and engage sports is better than sit at home.

Manufactured goods follow the same pattern in rail and road transportation: 25 % and 28 % apparently. Secondly, one third of rail transportations are taken by food. Roads are not usually used to transport machinery. Such transportations take 12%  of rail transportations.

I agree that for film producers and musicians the problem of pirate copies is an important problem. They spend a lot of money for making a produsing the art objects, but they haven’t got a money for using it.

As for me, I can say, that we all use pirates copies of films and music in our own life. When we have not enought money to go to cinema wasthing new film, we can also do it sitting at home, by Internet.

Now our life is going around Technical equipment and Internet technologys. So we all have a lot of opportunities to share with friends all information we like. So why can’t we share films or music we like not only with our friends, but to all Internet users?

According to my opinion, people who download copied files, instead of buying the original discs, shouldn’t be punished, because Internet gives them this opportunity. As for me, i think that we can use all we can get. And why we should spend a money for things we can get free in Internet? It is not problem of people, who get pirate copies of films and music. It’s a problem of those hackers who copy and share music or films on the Internet.

So, the copying and sharing pirate files is illegal and should be punished, because it leads to losing huge amounts of money by musicians and film producers. But Internet users are not guilty that they are given a lot of free content of information and they are not responsible for problem of Internet pirating.

There is a proverb in Latin ""panem et circenses"" that says people need food and shows - that is still true nowadays. British and especially American films are far more spectacular than any other movies (there is only one probable exeption - Indian Bolywood). For people it is much more interesting to watch some action movie with guns, cars and explosions like Fast and Furious. Fortunately, today we can find more films with deep meaning and ones that can be very inspiring, but general tendency shows that simple action movies are the most popular. They are so exciting due to expensive special effects, consequently, it is difficult to do it without money.

Secondly, one can produce a good movie easier when there is a financial support from government. Genius directors and scenarists undoubtedly exist but they cannot do anything because of lack of money. Holywood is a stable financial system but, for instance, in Russia it is extremely hard to find a financial support for a non-standard movie even if you are famous like Renata Litvinova. Russian government give financial support but unfortunately this system doesn't work well yet. The key problem is the evaluation of quality of films to be supported. The government should probably give not more money, but to more valuable films instead of giving it to most famous directors with standard plots.

Taking everything into account, it could be said that the key problems are tastes of people preferring expensive simple movies with much action and the government that should support really valuable local films instead of popular meaningless movies.",8

Indeed, it is terrifying to hear that some school boy did an awful thing. The causes of this social phenomenon are highly arguable, so possible measures. In my perspective, the main causes are living in a highly urbanized areas and being exposed to a lot of stress and temptations. To solve the problem, adults must provide the youth with a clear overview of their opportunities and the ways in which they can reach them.
Living in a highly urbanized cities affects the self-esteem of young people and their perception of the world. They observe different levels of life, namely the great richness and the miserable poverty. They see a lot of products they may want to have themselves, but cannot afford yet. Their peers can lure them to do things they otherwise would not do by suggesting them an easy way to get the products of their desire. This easy way is commiting a crime. Stress may cause the youth to prove themselves to their peers in this way. It strengthens the wish to get what they want righ now.
Although the solution may vary depending on a specific kase, some general ideas can be named. I think it is necessary for parents to clearly state the system of values that they adhere to. They should find a way to make their son or daughter willing to accept it and to share the common values. It is necessary to ensure that the child is not exposed to harmful influence of peer groups. Family values should be at the first place, and any other opinions should be perceived with reference to them. At the same time, teachers at school should provide an overview of possible things an individual could do for living. It can be providing an image of different professions and better under standing of how they may live when they grow. It will give the youth the ways in which they can achieve what they want and will allow to avoid the harmful un certainty which can stimulate them to commit a crime.
To sum up, to lower the crime rate among young people we must provide them with the aims and goals and possible ways in which they can achieve them. This will eliminate the influences of feeling temptations that they are often faced with.

Specialists all over the world say that the habit of constant use of these gadgets can lead to eyesight deterioration, especially for kids whose vision is not formed completely. How many times we have seen children who already have to wear glasses or eye lenses at this young age to see clearly?
Furthermore, it is proved that electronic devices produce certain levels of radioactive waves which is also harmful for our bodies. This affects blood steam and can lead to the increasing blood pressure, intense headaches and even heart attacs. However, there are not that much examples of such things happening, but the possibility still exists.
Moreover, intense usage of gadgets may cause strong addiction. There are evidences of people almost losing their minds due to their neverending need, for smartphones and other devices.
To conclude, it can be said that technologies brought lots of benefits but there are a lot of problems connected with them.

Some people argue that children are not controlled well by their parents, others tend to say that it is the government to blame for these issues. In this essay, I will outline different causes why young people commit crimes and possible solutions of how to tackle these issues.
Firstly, lots of people blame parents for not rearing their children in a proper way. Children who are not well prepared for the world's environment tend to riot and do illegal things just to prove thair uniqueness. Morever, uncontrolled children continiously play computer games with a lot of violence and if they are not aware of the possible harmfull consequences it may cause, they mirror the doing in the game to their lives and, as a result, become those who commit crime unconsiously.
Secondly, the government can be a cause. The more crimes exist, the less government use its special forces to protect people from crimes. What is more, police officers should be on duty in every part in any country. If the territory is well-obesvered, it is possible less dangerous because everything is clearly seen.
In these two cases, it is possible to provide several solutions to deal with these problems. First is to make parents oversee their children more often, which can be done by creating friendship relationship with children, at the same time not overwhelming them with the controll. Everything needs to be balanced. Second solution to the another cause can be creating extra police force and develop new ways to oversee the territory.

To conclude, I would like to say that the issue about young people who commit crimes is quite vital and needs to be studied more precisely. Each solution, whether it is providing the whole awareness of children that crimes are illegal, or whether it is about increasing the controlling of the therritory. Each solution is a long-term method, but tackling the problems about crimes should begin as quickly as possible.",6

In 2000 there was the highest rate of uneducated children in Africa, which falled in 2012. The persantage of girls who did not get proper education was a bit higher than the number of boys. The most positive trend was shown by South Asia. During these 12 years the amount of children decreased more than twice. Moreover, this significant drop was achieved by girls who could get access to primary school education. In 2000 other countries demonstrated the lowest percentage of uneducated children which was about a half of the same statistic sign in Africa. But in 2012 the situation changed and the rest of world was moved by South Asia as it was mentioned before.
The overall span is more positive than negative, in 12 years the number of uneducatied children decreased espessially in South Asia. Anyway, there were some regions showing not excellent dynamics, for instance, Africa.

People prefer to download films or music compositions and do not want to bye original versions of files.

On the one hand, I can understand people, who downloads files. It happens because of pries are rising so fast and people have not so much money for it. That’s why in the beginning we find files in the Internet and only if we can not find something what we need, we will buy it. In various countries industries have got different opportunities to control illegal process of making pirate copies. For example, in Russia approximately all media files you can find in web. However, in Europe, as I know, it is hardly to do copies and, of course, to download them.

On the other hand, it is really bad when musicians and film makers lose their money. This is their work and it is understandable that they want collect money for their job. It is really difficult to work in this spheare. This job takes a lot of time, energy, emotions. Let’s think about this problem. For instance, one film producer spend a lot of money and power for making film, however, people download it and do not go to the cinemas, do not pay for original discs. That’s why producers haven’t more opportunities for making his films and due to pirates copies he lose his job. I suppose that solution of this problem is decreasing prices.

In conclusion I want to say that all this points of view can be right. Now our general aim is happening people from music and cinemagraphic speare.

Indeed, the 20th century totally changes the lifestyle of people, because there have been invented some unbelievable things like the Internet or a mobile phone. Nevertheless, the idea that people depend in gadgets and technology often sounds in the environment. 

So, such total interest to using technology can not stay unnoticed for people’s health. The first issue is that the modern style of life (with constant using of technology) contrihifies to ‘sitting’ style of life, because almost all modern gadgets have an aim to make life more simple and comfortable. Sometimes or two places with four walls start to be only areas of human’s life. This man does not need even walking, because the Internet broadens horizons and gives new experience. Gradually, a man can become too fat or stop to see well, besides such style of life affects on a heart, which become too weak, so a problem of a heart-attach starts to be real. People should understand that the natural rhytm of life must include workouts and sport, so even if a man has a job, connected with modern technology, he should be sporty.

Another problem of using technology is that the ability to live without them can reduce. Modern technology surrounds people since the childhood, consequently if a man is in any difficult problem, which obliges him to undertake a responsibility about own life, he can loose the control and he certanly not to survive.

People can not stop wondering: What are the possible reasons to that? Is there anything that can be done to decrease this horrible tendency? In my opinion, one of the reasons of this issue roots in mass media, the Internet in particular.
Today it offers its users an unlimmited access to enormous amount of different data which should be filtered sometimes. An adult person can hardly handle this relentless flow of information, let alone our children. The perception of the young brain is prone to be influenced by others. For example, there can be found blogs, or groups in social media that have violence propaganda, abuse. Young people may be encouraged to break the law to get what the want or bully others to make them feel better about themselves. Some of these groups are even involved in serious crimes, such as robbery and murders.
The second reason is parenting. Nowadays we all have such a rush and try to gain more money than we probably can spend. Parents are to busy with work and household chores that they do not pay enough attention to their children. They rarely wonder that their kid is passionate about, whathe would like to do in his life. They mostly worry about their education and future salary.
This horrible lack of attention makes young folks look for it somewhere else and they find it online where they can do nothing but get sucked into the uncontrollable world of the Net.
I personally believe, that this issue should be considered as one of the most important. In schools they should teach how to filter the information you get while parens are to take care of the future of their child and pay more attention to their interests and at least be aware of the people that surround their kid.",7

The underground route in London is by for the longest, while Tokyo subway provides the highest amount of oassengers by transport per year.
From the 1864 to 1927 years underground system were opened in such a famous world cities, as London, Paris, and Tokyo. The first subway was opened in London in 1863, were 394 kilometres in route and was I pushed by 775 millions of people per year. Compare to this, Paris underground, founded in 1900, was almost half shorter, but allowed significantly more passengers to transport (1191). Tokyo railway, opened in 1927, was only 155 kilometres on route but, compare to previous system, helped to travel to almost 2000 millions passengers. 
In the second part if the 20th century, there were founded another three major railway systems, which although had significantly worse harasteristics. The Washington Dc system, opened in 1976, was 126 km in distance and had only 144 millions of passengers every year. The figures for the rest two undergrounds, Koyoto and Los Angeles, founded in 1981 and 2001, were considerably less than even in Washington DC. Koyoto subway had the shortest route, only 11 km, and the lowest rate of passengers ( 45 million per year). For Los Angeles figures were slightly better: 23 kilometres of route and 50 millions of people, using transport per year. 
Overall, summarizing all the dats given, it is obvious that underground systems, founded between the second half of the 19th century and the first half of 20th centery, had more significant transport characteristics and until today may provide transport provide successful transportation for larger amounts of people, than much younger subways, founded in the last three decades of the 20th century

But how strict should be the punishment for being unfair? Let us discuss the problem of illegal drugs, where some people claim that the people who use illegal drugs should be banned from the professional competition temporarily, while the others argue that they should be banned permanently.
Personally, I think that there can be no excuse for cheating in the professional sports competition, especially if it is very important, for example, world championship, or olympic games, that is why i think that people who use illegal drugs should be banned for the rest of their lives.
Firstly, the temporary bans, will not be much of a reason for the sportsmen to not to use drugs, because after the time is gone they will continue their career as if this situation never took place before. It is obvious for me that many of them tried to use drugs at least once, just to see what happens. Only the complete ban from the future professional competition will solve the problem, as it will encourage fear of using drugs among the sportsmen.
However, many of the people will disagree with this opinion. They will argue that the complete ban from future professional competition will sometimes result in misjudment and spoiled careeres for the sportsmen. The complete ban from the professional competition is too severe to be a solution in their opinion.
Nevertheless, I cannot agree with their opinion. Misjudgement is a part of every law and can happen any time, no matter how strict are the laws themselves. If a person is misjudged somehow, he can prove his innocence, and the lack of evidence can also be a reason for innocence.
In conclusion, I would like to say that sport is a sport and it must be fair. There can be no place for illegal drugs and for people who try to use them in their own interest.

The problem is stated more serious than ever. What are the causes of this situation? How can parents and teachers help to solve this problem?
Nowadays people often do not spend enough time teaching moral to their children. The reason why young people start commiting crimes is the absence of understanding the consecuenses of their behavior. Children should be taught not only about punishments for criminals, but also about impact of crime on ordinary people.
On the one hand, parents should teach their children that if everybody would be kind to each other, there would be no crime and nobody would suffer from thefts, nobody will be killed or hurt. But if anybody starts to break the law, stimuls for other people to do the same things appear. The net effect leads to development of illegal business. That means that every criminal not only harms people with illegal actions but also stimulates the crime.
However the learning moral aspect is not enough. Young people should be taught at school which actions are legal and which are not and which kings of punishments follow different crimes. This side of education helps to exclude the situations when people commit crime without understandind the fact that they are breaking the law.
All things considered, the problem of crime development should be solved through education, which consists from two equally important parts: moral aspect and learning the law. First thing should be teached by the family, while second one can be teached by school teachers.

I do not agree this statement because in some countries it would make the lack of products. 

First and foremost it countries would produse food that their own people consume there will be no difference between consumable products in countries and this idea will not change list of products in these countries. 

Secondly, decrease of import products may has really bad impact on some countries. It may call the lack of products because these countries do not produce any food and whole amount of products is imported from other countries. If countries will try to exchange imported products by produced their people they will lose a lot of money and time. That makes this idea useless. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that countries must not only import food but also produce it.

Media provides us news about murders, beatings and shopliftings committed by young people more and more frequently. This essay analyzes causes of this phenomenon, and what can be done by parents and teachers to solve it.
I personally think that there are two reasons of this development. The first one is that today more and more young parents prefer their career growth rather than care for their family. So, when a child is born, she receives much less attention from her parents. Later, she finds new friends, who probably grew up in the same conditions, and they do not have a set of moral values that should have been taken from their parents. As a result, they do not know what is good, and what is bad, and this group of children may become a small gang when they realize that there is easier to receive money by robbing than by legal ways. There is the additional factor which I consider as the second reason: accessibility of information that may be inappropriate for a child. The lack of parents' attention can be replaced by Internet and videogames, and the child learns new knowledge about violence, drugs or something like that very quickly but without right explanation And it can also create the wrong set of values and lead him to become a criminal.
In my opinion, what parents should do is to give enough care and attention to their children. They should control what their child watches, reads or plays, and who are her companions. However, not only parents but school teachers can make their influence on this issue: for instance, they can teach children not only math and language, but also about how to socialize and become a righteous citizen.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the problem of crimes committed by youth is very important; however, it can be reduced or eliminated by parents and teachers in primary schools.

In my view, the most common reason which provokes to commit a crime is a wish of teenagers to show themselves in front of their mates. They do not want to be an ousider in the young group and they try to do something fascinating and wonderful, however they have not got any ideas but for to break the law. People of this age would like to be respectful, that is why they show their power. Our modern mass media also influences on the young brains. Due to abcense of censorship and a large amount of violence, the youth is becoming much more agressive than ever before. They need to get rid of their energy and then they find a way to go out the line.
The most useful way to decrease the amount of young criminals is to allow their extra energy to go in the another place. Theit parents and teachers should motivate them to find a hobby, which is able to take a lot of time. If it is impossible or very complicated for a teenager, the teachers should to increase the amount of extra lessons, to add sport activities after the main school lessons.

Currently the highest number of crimes relates to the age group of young people while in the past this trend wasn't so catastrophical. In this essay I will discuss possible reasons why it happens and provide potential solutions to crack down on the existing problem.
One possible reason of its happening can be explained by the development of cutting-edge technology. A bunch of sources became accessible than they had been before. As a result young people have infinite variaty of information from entertaiments to cruel videos. For instance, they watch films where there are killings, rapings, maggings and other types of crime. It leads to the development of the feeling that a crime is such a common thing that is normal to commit because in the screen it is committed so often. They observe that some of people who committed a crime are not caught, sent to the prison and punished. They want to be similar to their favourite protagonists from the screen, to those ""bad boys"". One of the possible solutions can be done by making a prohibition for young people to visit sites where there are such films. But first of all people should create separated sites where there are these movies.
The second reason can be explained the the lack of bringing up amoung young people. The fact is that some parents work around the clock and they practically do not have enough time to talk to their children, to explain them to what possible consequences their crime actions can lead and how it is actually scared. As a result children raise by their own communicating and spending time somewhere in the street with children whose situation in the family is similar to theirs. One of probable solutions to this problem can be done by changing working hours among adults who have children under the age. They should be given flexible working hours with the possibility sometimes to work from home in order they do not spend time in transport but spend this time with their family.
In conclusion, this is actually one of the most terrible problem in our society that escalates day by day. All the measures to solve it should be done immidiately otherwise it will lead to disastrous consequences.",7

First of all, we all live in the age of globalization. All cultures become slightly closer to each other. Some scientists even claim that there are no longer any local cultures, as all of them have been replaced with one global culture. Though, parts which different countries take in this global culture are known not to be equal. British and American cultures have influenced other cultures a lot. That is why nowadays people watching films prodused in these countries or reading books written there are indeed connected with that global culture more than those who do not.
The second reason for people to watch British or American films rather than locally produced ones is that the first, as I personally believe, are more mass-oriented. What I mean by this is that films prodused there do not contain any hidden sense (though some films might pretend to do so, but, in my opinion, it is only a strategy to please someparticular kinds of spectators). The logic of British and American films is quite clear (in comparison to, let us say, Custuritsa's or Kislyovsky's films). It is also possible to say that people do not need to think a lot or to solve some puzzles to completely understand these films. And this strategy works perfectly, as people nowadays like watching films mostly in oder to relax and give their minds some rest.

Sometime modern artists make their works whichcould seem so disgusting or not allowed to show a young children, but creative artist don't think about it. For example, modern artistfrom Saint Petersburg who came to Moscow and nailed himself onto red square, moreover without any clothes. Also hedid something extraordinairy. He sewed up his lips with red strings. And as he said it was expressing hius ideas and it was his way of expressing himself. I absolutely sure, that he is not only one artist who make same things, so I believe it is unusual. 
But, on the other hand, there are as many interesting modern artists who make really perfect pictures, paintings and other thing. Also there are a street culture calked a Graffiti. People use spray paint and drow something on the walls of building and of fences. It looks cool but police and government not allow to do this, despiteto that fact that people like it and cand supportg their works, they can enjoy them. 
To sum up, creative artists heve not to irritate citizens and other ordinairy people, because if people will not support them it make no sence for all.

For example, tell more and better to children about good and bad things. It’s not so hard work, but it’s very important, this mission have to perform parents and social together. Also if you want to beat a crime you have to make higher the level of life in your country, make it so good that people don’t need to go on extremely hard job for incredibly low money and have to go an bad criminal road of life. It’s the first problem of governments, let’s look to Canada, Finland, the level of the life in this countries very good, and, as a rule, crime is unbelievably low. And look to Afghanistan and Pakistan, people have to leave their countries because there are no any pretty good job, there are too many ways, crime, and every day they have a revolution of the new government.

This essay agrees this point: modern technology can cause some problems with eyes, pressure and weight. Some recomendations can help to reduce these problems. This essay will discuss some of problems and offer some solutions.
The biggest part of modern technology consists of gadgets like tablets, smartphones, etc. They can cause some health problems, because people spend a lot of time on them. Some of diseases are: head pain, high pressure, problems with eyes and overweight. These problems are very serious and they required some ways that can help to reduce them. For instance, 2016 research, published in the New York Times showed, that over than 50% of Americans are overweight because of the lack of physical activity. Many children do not want to go in for sports because they want to play computers or smartphones. There is another factor, that can cause health problems - radiation, produced by gadgets.
But some solutions of these problems can be offered. People should spend more time in the fresh air, doing some physical activities. Employers should encourage their workers who comes to office by bycicle, for example. In Moscow there is a practise of helding spring action ""On work by bycicle"" and MSU university research shows that 45% of workers take part in it. Also, parents should spend a lot of time with children and go together to picnics, for example.
In conclusion, this essays agrees, that modern technology is not good for people's health, but there are some methods that can help to reduce health diseases.

Some people believe that it is not fair while such companies can pay less money for the empoyees, and others suggest that business companies tries to help such countries with the development.The reasons for this are outlined below.  On the one hand, moving their business into developing countries means that the company wants to contribute in its current economical situation. Such companies pay money for land, worker, assuarance and, in many case, bring there their own experts so to educate the workers and to introduce modern technologies into the plants and factories.The international  companies almost always invest in many charity organisation and give extra investment into the economy. Such benefits have a positive influance on the whole countries.  It also becomes easier to companies to orginise their work in the developing countries because usually it costs extremely cheaper than in their own countries. However, many companies use such possibility to save money. For instance, the size of worker's salaries in not as high as it can be in the developed countries. Many bussinesmen suggest that worker in developing countries does not need a higher salary even though emplyees do the same amount of work as in the prosperous countries. The other aspect where companies want to save money is work condition, which can be not correspond to the appropriate standard. Then the lack of medical care is also a significant point. Local workers almost always are not provided with the suitable medicial care.  Personally, I believe that such drawbacks are significant enough to outweigh the benefits. The modern society schould control the companies when they want to thansfer their bussines so that these disadvantages can be overcome.  To sum up, moving bussines from thriving countries to poorer ones should be done appropriately. So, international companies should bring more benefits both to the busisines owners and to the local population.   ",7

Therefore a lot of people consider that there should be increased the amount of sports facilities, while the other claim it would be inappropriate. As far as I am concerned, I believe public health should be improved with the help of other measures.


Firstly, the process of improvement of public health requires modern  infrastructure that provides hospitals and other related services. Undoubtelly, only professional doctors are able to ensure our health. Secondly, public health is dependant on the food that we eat, that is why the government should care about its quality using certain measures.


However, people that follow the alternative point of view, are convinced that the best way to make people stay healthy is to provide more and more sports facilities. Furthermore, they suppose that organising special contests and events like the Olympiads would help a lot to improve public health because a lot of sports centers are built for such kinds of events.


To sum up, due to the fact that there exist two absolutely different points of view, it remains a contentions issue. However, the opinion that states sports facilities is the most effective way to improve public health can be easily refuted: if people do not have a will to stay healthy, sports facilities will not help. At the same time my arguments appear to be quite logical, unbiased and fair.

To my mind, that statenment is partly true. I see it as a result of lack of morality in our everyday life. Due to the fact that teens do not see a good example of behavour, they start to act as ""cool"" and ""bad guys"" from movies. Thus, they pretend to be worse than they actually are. The second reason may be the social status of their family. It is not a surprise that a poor person may steal someone`s wallet to buy some food for himself or for his familly. These circumstances shall also be taken into account. The third reason is concerned the parents of such deviant teenagers. I belive that they do not pay enough ofattention to what their children do in their spare time and to what they are keen on. Sometimes teens just want more attention to themselves and do everything not to be ignored.

To solve the problem of teenagers` criminality parents and teachers have to work together. I may give some pieces of advice to them. Firstly, parents shall control what their children watch in the Internet or on the TV to reduce the bad influence. Moreover, teachers may show good films such as ""One flight over the cockoo`s nest"" in school to educate the teens. Beside, parents shall give a good example of how to behave to their children. You can not blame your children for being rude if you are also rude. Sometimes young people need more love from their parents and it can be helped just by being nice to them. Finally, teachers shall help teenagers becoming better and not just punish them for every mistake that they make.

To sum up, the problem of teenagers`s criminality comes from different places. The teenagers are not only ones to blame. To be honest, I would like the society to assist deviant teens with socializing. I hope that one day there will be less criminals among the young people.",7

By knowing the history, I absolutely agree with the statement that the art should be out of any political or ethetical broadens.
Today in all civil world books, films, singles aren’t restricted by the politicians. For example, there are some singers in Russia who aren’t afraid to speak about the injustice of the Russian law. From the other hand, the incident of Pussy Riot became known to the whole world. In the human’s history the development of art reached the peak during some historical events. The famous writer of the Golden Age of russian poetry Pushkin was a dekabrist, for example. In this way I consider that sometimes the restrictions develop the Art, make it more innovative. When some people do not like the situation in their country, they always speak about it in their songs, films, books, pictures and etc.
But the government is a great power, and it is necessary to remember about it. And sometimes the influence of the government can be so distructive that the art would be almost killed. 
During the repressions of Stalin not very many artists were brave enough about the things which had happened in the country. So the art was innatural; it was a lie for looking like good and right soviet man. In the 60s, after the death of Stalin, all these things that had not been spoken about began to appear with enormous intense. In this period the type of artists named abstagonists appeared at the stage. But their pictures weren’t understood by the government, so the restrictions began again. It was not in their power to strike with this great force, some of artists went abroad, other stayed to their sorrow.
The art will always alive, but in some situations the restrictions can make it poor, can make the people suffer.

Nevertheless, many people agrel that there are better approaches to punishment. It can be argued that longer sentences isolate criminals and, consequently, do not let them commit new crimes. Apparently, many murders and robbers tend to neglect law and repeat their murders and robberies. For instance, there was serial killer in the USA, who attempted to kill a family just after lies sentence had finished. Hence, longer limitations restrict such infamous people. Having said that, the criminal will have carried his burden to one day anyway, so this solution does not guarantee constant safety. On the other hand, many people are in favour of the idea that capital punishment or obligatory jobs re more appropliate. The former is the most effective way to get rid of the most violent killers. Obviously, after the death penalty new crimes are impossible. Although seemingly beneficial for society, it is worth nothing that the approach is in human and entalls new murders. The other debatable option is to let some people be punishes by monitory activities.  The reason for it is simple: the government will not allocate money for prisons. Moreover, there will be additional saved funds from criminals free labor force. Talking everything into account, I deem the second option is feasible. In case the repeated crime is inevilable, it is better to either, completely reduce its probability to get financial profits. Of two evils choose the besser.

The first reason of this problem can hide in a childhood. Nowadays parents spend a lot of time at work. This causes lack of time, which parents should give to their childrens. This lack leads us to lack of education about good and evil, and concequences of evil steps. There could be another reason of our problem. Poor families quite often have more than one child. If parents don’t try to educate their children properly before school, children can get in some bands. People from these bands can provide teenagers with money, but they will ask teenagers to do some “dirty job”.
There are a lot of solutions of this problem. First of all, parents should give more attention to their children and spend more time with them. These points can increase trust in future, and parents will be able to understand, with whom their childrens are communicating more. Therefor, government should pay more attention to the poor group of nation, and make thought-provoking propaganda about crimes. These measures will help children to avoid marginal groups of people.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that problem of rising amount of youngsters, who commites a crime, can be solved by parents, teachers and government. The main idea is to give more time and attention to children and their social life.

This group of people spend most of their time in school, walking or at home. It can be caused by different things, such as people around a person, teachers, which can probably teach students something inappropriate or parents which don't spend enough time with their child. Solution for the problem have to touch one of groups of people described above.
Firstly, parents have to control their child's interests and people around him. Children usually don't know which society they meet in the streets to join. Because of their wrong choices, sometimes they are being pushed for illegal activities and sometimes they get wrong understanding of the world. In the era of the Internet, children's intrests can go by a dangerous way, because the Internet is full of violence and inappropriate materials which anyone can get access to.
Secondly, teachers should learn students how to make a right choice. How to choose friends, how to get respect in society, how to behave to become independent and successfull.
Also, in the modern world, there should be teached a cyber safety subject in schools. It is important to protect children from the Internet's influence. Teachers should also make the marks of students available for their parents to make their mother and father understanding if everything is fine with their child.
To decrease the amount of crimes made by younger people, parents should watch their developing and control it, spend more time to make their child more adapted to modern society. As for teachers, they should learn their students to pick a right side in society and how to use the Internet right. Using this solutions, we can decrease the children crime rate.

To begin with, it is worh saying that any vehical can damage the nature (not only plants and animals but also the Humanity): air planes produce special gazes which pollute the atmosphere (moreover, it is unnecessary to say, that every plane crush can kill several cube kilometers the live beings).What is more, all this time the government closes its eyes when this question rises but if it create a special law and control the situation, everything can dramatically change; the amount of flights will be minimised and the nature will be saved (but some international companies will lose lots and lots of money (and a lot of people will be hired)).
On the other hand, it sounds strange: the law which is made for the reducing air flights.That is why I see another solvation: the only way to improve this situation is to creat a grant for scientists (of all the countries). So they would invent the new type of planes which would be ""pollution free"" and its using would not cause any climat problems.However, there is a long way because it should be done in all the countries (including small ones where the cheep and old versions of flying vehicles are used (because they pollute more then others)): so all people should unite to provide our grandchildren with fresh and clean air, with the possibility to see white bears and penguins (which would not extinct because of global warming) etc.

I don’t think there is a proper way to define happiness. You don’t know what happiness os until you experience it and each time it can be caused differently. Some say money brings you happinness, some say love, but is it truly this simple?
First of all, let’s not forget that all human beings are different, with different values and backgrounds, we were taught differently. So some believe that happiness is something that can’t be bought or made it’s not materialistic – something you can reach or achieve in your life. Love, family, harmony. On contrary, there are people who strongly believe that happiness is in their job, in money they get, in many many houses they can have. Maybe these new shoes will make you happy so you go and buy it.
Another thing is that people of different cultures see happiness in different ways. While the West world is more self-centered, the Eestern is all about collective values. Westerns think of happiness as something that can only be achieved if you succeed in life, Easterns though find happiness in belonging to a community, being a good mother or father, for example, they live as their parents expect them to.
Furthemore, there are different religions with their own perception of happiness, their followers have to agree with these perceptions.
There’s no such thing that can define happiness in a simple word of sentence.
In conclusion, I’d like to say that happiness is a very tricky topic to talk about. It means different things to different people and each one descides what it means to him and finds his or her own ways of achieving happiness. But clearly it is one of the main goals on lives of almost everybody.

So, what should be done to reduce crime? For me, personally, i think the best way to get rid of crimes is to invent very strict laws and punishments, which you know you could not break or escape.
Many people believe that by giving longer prison sentences we will reduce crime. I can partly agree with this statement. Firstly, longer prison sentences may cause the fear of staing in prison forever. It is scary to know that you are stuck in the same space for a long amount of time, unable to do things you like. Also, the lac of privacy for many people could be dramatising. Secondly, by extanding the amount of time in prison, you give criminals time to think about what they have done and it gives them a chance to change the way they see the world around and even to change themselves. But does it work like that for evereone?
That is why other people suggest different way of reducing crime. Other then punishments and fines, it would be great if our government would provide jobs for people who was realised out of prison, because for those people it is very hard to start a normal life, to get a job, so they could break the law again in order to get money for food and clothes.Increasing the amount of money you pay as a fine is anouther way ti reduce crime. I think that not so many people would be able to offord to pay thousands of money to keep out of prison, so they would think twice before commiting a crime. Also, more strict punishments would be essentual. If people know what they are going to face if they break the law and if they know that the would not be able to escape it, they definately would not even think about commiting a crime.
All in all, i think that stric laws and punushments are essantial to make a healthy society and providing ex prisoners a job could be benefituak not only for them, but also for the gouvernement",7

It takes a lot of talent and knowledge to develop the necessary equipment, and huge sums of money too. Governments of the biggest countries make investments in exploring the space outside planet Earth, and it leads to a question: wouldn't it be better to focus on the problems around us, make people's lives on Earth better, and solve the planet's issues before looking up into the space?
Science and inventions are what made the humanity move fordward for centuries. Space exploration is one of the newest fields and there is still a lot to be done and found out. The technologies developed by space explorers may later be used in everyday life, they help environmentalists to protect the planet from destroying processes such as global warning.
One of the goals set by space explorers is to find a way to leave the planet if something goes wrong and save the humanity at least partly. I suppose this is not the best goal because we should focus on preventing such a situation and caring about everybody's lives instead of making sure there is a way to escape for some outstanding individuals.
Also there is a big wealth gap in the society and people who work in very closed and technological fields, such as space exploration, clearly have a higher income. As for me the problem of poverty can be fixed by a more balanced income rate in different professional fields.
So personally I can neither agree nor disagree with the given opinion.

Thirdly, all Internet users should understand that copying or downloading information with the mark C (or with others with same meaning) is illegal. That is why every website should contain at least one paragraph with information why it is illegal (links on particular documents).

Finally, we should change the fact that speaking about the Internet we imagine absolutely free and independent area. This rude mistake leads to idea that every action on the Internet is unreal, but it is not true. Problem of thefting intellectual property is fully shown on the Internet. there is no doubt that without the Internet there were cases like an efficient law base that will control the Internet and punish all users who illegally share and download information. All punishment should be strict and real.

To sum up, thefting intellectual property on the Internet is a serious crime and everybody must understand that it is impossible to get away with it.

If a painting is not realy intime it will not be better with the imaqge or idea ina head of its creator. There are some time or space limits which could not be avoid.
My opponents may think that masterpieces won't be born in such strict conditions. There is a blog of famous russian artist Lebedev, where he is writing, that some rules are necessary. His organisation works are well-known, however, there are rules in his company. First of all, he does not care about the time, in what his employees come to work, but there are deadlines and the time restrictions in which the work must be finished. The artists can ware that they like but the clothes must be clkean and nit wierd or outstanding if it can shock others. The work place should be organized differently, like in Yandex. In office they have cookies and couches. However it does not disturbe from work,moreover informal atmosphere help people to generate new ideas.

There are several major reasons that cause such tendency. This essay is aimed to reveal causes and give some solutions to overcome the problem.

First of all, many researches proved that there are high rates of crime nowadays due to the fact that younger people commit crimes. It is told that many of them were born and live in the areas where a burglary or even a murdery are everyday things. These teenagers originate from families where there are only one parent or parents work hard to bring up children so breadgivers do not have that much time to spend with their own children. It could be suggested to parents to try and find some time to talk more to their children, educate them, discribe them what is allowed to do in the society. Children should be given more attention from parents. For example, supportive talks with children, asking about their lifes, everyday dinner together can help to change the situation for the better.

Secondly, the moral values of modern society have changed. It became a commom thing among teenagers to do something illegal. One thing that can be done to solve the problem is to pay more attention to this problem at school. For instance, teachers can give lectures about the drawbacks and outcomes of commiting a crime where they will explain to the youth everything. Moreover, more literature with positive and apprecheated life examples can be read during the lessons.

To conclude, it can be said that regardless of differnt reasons of crimes we should start doing something to prevent new crimes. Personally I suppose that combining both of these methods will give the best result and have a real influence on what the younger generation considers to be right.",7

A person may doubt and question the assumption whether the advantages outweigh the backwards. To give my own opinion I would like to consider this issue providing some arguments for and against the project.
To begin with, In case the system is not overseen and prepared profoundly, it may lead to severe consequences. It is necessary to create a particular part of country’s budget from which people will be paid. As a result, the government has to reduce or even discontinue the financial support for some important spheres of life such as military or poor population support. To prevent this, the government should raise taxes which are not likely to be approved by people.
On the other hand, receiving a guaranteed sum of money every month enables to have lots of opportunities. Indeed, for most fractions of the society this system can become a good support and base in some struggling situations in life that are common nowadays. For example, because of economic problems a person gets fired from job but still has his or her fixed income which will probably allow them to start up or at least live normally until they find a proper job. In conclusion, having considered this subject and both advantages and disadvantages, I believe that the benefits of such a system will outweigh the backwards as it is a perfect social support program.",7

Therefore, as many people suppose, the only way to solve this problem is the prolongation of the prison period. In contrast, other people state that it is insufficient and such a situation needs more effective actions. In this essay I will examine both these views and try to offer my own solution. On the one hand, as the first group of people believe, the level of crime (which raised dramatically in last decades, as different surveys demonstrate it) can be reduced only by keeping ""evil"" in the prison for as much time as possible. Firstly, it can truly protect the society from those criminals who had already showed its deviant behaviour. Furthermore, the amount of recidives is so sizeable that it must be taken into consideration. Secondly, during the whole period of its existence, humanity did not provide any more effective ways to stop criminals than puninshment - and if this punishment is strictrer, the criminals would afraid to get in prison. Lastly, such a way does not any modifications in the current state system since the prison net already exists - hence it is more affordable for the government.  On the other hand, the first position is often refuted by the second group of people. They state that prison system is not up-to-date and can not reduce crime even if the prison sentences would be longer. First of all, it should be taken into account that the influence of the prisons on reducing crime is not proved by the surveys, and the fact of recedives demonstrate that prisons can not ""correct"" people. Apart from that, the prison system itself is utterly expensive for the government and hence need more and more taxes from the simple citizens; undoubtedly, the prolongation of the prison period would impact on the cost of its maintenance. Therefore, several alternative ways of reducing crime are offered. For instance, some people suppose that the development of the policy system can help to stop the crime events instead of stricter punishments after this event. Moreover, the society can influence on criminals ""softer"" than by strict prisons and try to prevent the situation when an ordinary man becomes a criminal. Namely, the government should help poor families and their children since they are mostly predisposed to crime (as the example of African, some Asian and other poor countries demonstrate it). Finally, the education and moral systems should be improved in order to enhance the moral self-control of each member of the society. All in all, I partly agree with both these views and, furthermore, I suppose that they are not so contrast as they seem. From my point of view (despite the fact that my opinion may seem too superficial), all these ways may be combined in order to prevent the human from crime and to reduce the amount of such situations. The government is obliged to strict the prison conditions and simultaneously develop systems which can influence people's minds more effectively - education or moral system (including schools and universities), supporting those who can not provide themselves without a crime. If all these methods are gathered, it will truly contribute to reducing crime in modern society.  ",7

But what are the ways to do it and how effective they really are? Some people say that increasing prison sentences is the way to go. People who fear being locked up for a really long time are less likely to commit a crime, they say. This conclusion is fairly easy to come to, but is it really the most humane and effective way? Opposers of such notion say that it is not. As statistics show, many people who were in prison later commited another crime and got into the prisons again. This shows the current ways of sentencing people and working on them in prison are ineffective. Some people propose better psychological work on prisoners, and, later on, giving some help to former prisoners to make their path to normal life easier. Such help may consist of social adoption courses, giving education to people still in prisons, or, maybe, offering work to newly free citizens. As for me , I am closer to the second camp. Making people live in fear and ruining their whole lives due to one mistake may be too harsh. Also, less strict laws may also improve the situation. Recent decriminalization of all drugs in Portugal. For example, greatly reduced overdose count and drug gang activity, which in turn leads to better and happier population. To conclude, there exist several opinions on reducing crime, most of which are legitimate and possible ways to go, so the only possible way to decide is a democratic one, because of pros and cons of all of the ways.

The benefits of this system are pretty obvious. Every person will get some money, which can also help in difficult situation. There are some people who are not in the category of old people or invalids, but they still can have problems with finances. Also every person in the country has a right to get some money from selling and reproducing the nation goods of their country. For example, many people in Russia are not satisfied, that they don’t get anything from our natural goods, from selling gas, oil, gold and other things to other countries.
However, this idea also has some disadvantages. Giving money from governmental budget to every citizen can be dangerous for economy of the country. It can lead to the growth of costs for different products, crisis and laziness of the population. It can take many years to stabilize the economic situation. Also, this system can lead to deficit of the governmental budget and decline of money given to some governmental organizations, like schools, hospitals and others.

This serves as an important example to the fact that games may cause young people to follow a crime path.

Moreover, movies and especially Sci-Fi films are becoming even more realistic than before. There is an abundance of action films, thrillers, horrors that all feature killing people, mutilation, going over the limits. What is disturbing that this is often shown as if it were easy to accomplish, naturally offering children and adolescents an example.

In other words, the causes lie in the incessant flow of violence from games and movies which trigger the desire to try this in real life. Some of the possible solutions to this problem include restricting video games and movies and promoting lawful behaviour.

Video games and movies could be restricted by age groups, so that games and movies that are only permitted to adults would only be allowed with parental supervision. For example, a game rated 18+ would only be allowed to adults or children with adult supervision, provided that adult consider the game appropriate.

It is also paramount that there be increased teaching and promotion of lawful behaviour. Schools should teach their students to obey the law and to think their actions thoroughly. Penal code should be taught at schools, so that young people know what could follow if they decide to act against the law.

To conclude, the two causes that raise the issue of increased crime rate are violent video games and movies, which may be solved by imposing age limits on games, movies and promoting lawful behaviour.",7

Personally, I'm sure artists have to be given freedom in self-expression. This essay will analyze why it is the only possible way.


Firstly, really creative people have been known from times immemorial as not only artists, but as individuals who look far in the future, bring truth to people and inspire them to change the world to the better, so they need to be heard.


Secondly, any government restrictions can not make a true artist silent. His poems, music or films may become even more wide spread then before due to intake instinct of people to be free, in reading or watching something as well, and restrictions will only stimulate people's interest to creations of the artist. Our country experienced it in 20 century.


However, there is a belief that independence in creating of any art form has bad consequences. Artists are not saints, and some of their works sometimes include immoral content, which spoils person's spiritual world. Moreover, such art can influence people to bring harm to society.


All things considered, I believe the positives of giving freedom to artists outweigh its drawbacks. Art is pure in its nature, if a person is a true artist, his works will only benefit the society, and the question who can be considered as a true artist is another issue to discuss.

However, there are some groups which are disagree with this opinion. As for me, I completely agree with the siggested statment, based on increasing of new laws. It could help to dicrease the amount of consumers in air tourism. Futhermore, this decision may lead to necessity of creating of new ways of fuels for plane, wich would not be such insecure, as it was before.
Initially, it should be said creating of the new code, wich would not exept the public usage of air travels for buisness and leisure needs, could make people think about journey by train insread of plane. It is evident, this type of transerring could be observed as much less harmful for the nature. For example,train could transport more amount of passenger for one time, than plain. Accordingly, it would cause less damage.
The necessity of refusing from air travels, moreover, may open plemty of new possibilities for humanity in general. If the people had not abilities for utilising of habitual ways of engines, theey would have to invent something new. Scientists, for instance, would have much more stimules for creating modern safety types of fuel.

Also people of the middle generations are in between by the ammount of usage that network.

The second social network is Instagram.There the situation is really close to the Facebook. However, the elder generation has a tiny persentage of users, while the younger generation has approximately a half of Instagram`s auditory.

To conclude, it is obvious that the younger generation use such networks as Facebook and Instagram more often than the older generation. In these two networks the usage decreases according to the aging of the auditory. In contrast, in Linkedn the usage is more connected to the social status, because that network is usually used by working class to find a job or to communicate with your collegues.

Free films and music are only two of them. At the era of the fast Internet we can share different files almost without any limits. Due to this, the problem of illegal copying is arising today.
Some people think that spreading music albums and films on the Internet must be recognised as a crime, and people who has committed that should be gone on trial. As for me, I totally agree with their position.
Firstly, any film, song or any other piece of art is author’s property. This means that, for example, only director can decide to whom he would sell or demonstrate his film. Copying this property is unacceptable. In modern democratic countries the power of law should protect the right of self-property and punish those who violate the law. Moreover, it can be recognised as stealing money and labour from artists which is also illegal.
Secondly, copying and sharing music and films fo free can have a bad influence on the economy growth. Intertaining business, which includes films and music, is usually a huge part of country’s income (for example, the USA). So, if you steel films and songs, it is equal if you steel products and create a kind of “black” or “shade” market on the Internet. The economy suffers a lot due to illegal transactions because it looses masses of money and product turnover.
All in all, any type of steeling should be forbidden in modern countries. Copying and sharing music and films on the Internet is definitely a theft and have to be punished. Today Nobody doubts that money stealing is a crime and that you are not allowed to take someone’s property without paying for it. So why should we let internet thefs commit their crimes and more? I strongly believe that there is no reasons for that.

It is important to understand how to fight it, and that is why we need to point out the possible reasons of the trend.
First of all, the modern world is largely urbanized. And with urbanization, the era of traditional families passes, giving a way to nuclear modern-type families.
Many of the latter have a single child, and contact with their relatives rarely. As a result, children from these families might not have a close person – that is, a sister, a brother or a grandparent, - to interact with and develop socially. This may give a life to mental problems, making a person socially dangerous.
Another reason behind these crimes may be the rosen popularity of the Internet. Without any doubt, there are plenty of benefits provided by the Internet, such as an ability to communicate with people across a sea, learn almost any information and read any book. Yet, the sense of being connected to the whole world makes a person vulnerable to the words of people trying to verbally offend them, and that may be a motivation for commiting a hate crime, especially if you are young and expressive.
How can the society try to solve this problem? To soften the negative effects that I have written about above, the following could be done.
First teachers at school should be observing closely each child’s psychological state to give them any needed support. Secondly, the parents need to pay close attention to what their children watch and read, on the Internet and beyond, to save them from negative impacts.
Fighting against crimes, it is important to remember to care about people who can potentially commit it.

Morover, import food it have highest cost than population eats. It important for many people because they economy their money.

On the other hand, import is a good thing because there are some fruicts and vegetables which very difficult to produce in own population because it depend of climate. In this case countries need to help each others and their aim to import only fresh food. There are people which support this idea to import food not to aim to give money but to aim to have a good or tropic food, with they never can to produce in their own country.

For instance, future friends can share their personal advice, can help each other and simply go to match in oder to relax or vote for the favourite team. At the same time, people should be rather careful at sport matches, because there are a lot of opponents who can easily make the conflict or gang up to fight.

To begin with, it s wortwhile to remember that professional sport is a specific lifestyle. Therefore, the decision to bond the life with it implies the responsibility, one might make an inner agreament with the rules of this society. This provoke the idea that the athletes caught, should be banned from participating in the competitons for the rest of their lives. Virtually, this opinion is based on the term of ""professional honesty"" that is extremly significant in any professional area.
Otherwise, as the famous quote says ""I am a man and nothing human is foreign to me"". All people make mistakes and one false step might be punished but should not occur to be the fatal in someone's life. Even gads provide the opportunities to alter the views and undertake a novel attempt. Such a stance breed the idea of a part-time ban.
To summarize, the use of illegal drugs in sport is a pertinent issue to discuss as the professional sport requires the respect to others and the responsibilities for decisions, but at the same time everybody is reckoned to have a right on mistake. As far as I am concerned, those punishments should be only for some time as sometimes people do not realize that they are doing on the way to their dream.

Governments have an opportunity to support local films, but there is a question about its necessarity.
Firstly, these people definitely has reasons to watch other country's films and ignore local products. Probably their country makes bad quality films having no plot, with absolutely non-talanted cast. In this case inhabitans will watch films they like more. It is easy to find something special from a great number of British and American films. Moreover, film industry in America is the greatest one, so it is sponsored well and has an experience in producing the best films in history.
However, it would be a nice idea to give a chance to local films. It is hard to make a good film which can be compared with Hollywood's products, if you have not enough money. If government wants to lead their film industry to the first place, it should support local movie makers, but not all of them. As far as I am concerned, some films do not deserve supporting with money because of its lack of ideas. Money cannot change the plot or give a talant for some actors. A well-sponsored film will probably have a huge level of graphic design, wonderful costumes and ubiquitous advertisment, but it is not the main reasons to call some film great. A good film contains an exciting plot and cast which makes you feel all things that is describing in the film by yourself.
People usually choose British and American films for watching because of some reasons. It is important to support local film industry in order to make it better, but not all of them, as far as not all of local films have a bad quality only because of lack of money.",7

Whilst some people struggled for it, others advocated against it. Let is discuss the main advantages and disadvantages phenomenon.


On the one hand, many people are confident that freedom of art is a necessary part of any modern government. First of all, it gives everyone an opportunity to express themselves as well as show the reality. Therefore, it can be inconvinient for some authorities. For example, in USSR there was a strong censorship at every stage including art, thereby those who didn't follow the rules were punished dramatically. This seems to be absolutely savage nowadays, although it still takes place in some countries. It is proven that censorship presence leads to a massive depression which is a bad sign for any government. In order to keep their position, they should provide freedom to the citizens, including artists. The other reason to support it is that any art debelops only with new ideas. It is dreadful to forbid artists to create, as the art can simply dissapear.


On the other hand, there is always a flip side. Many groups of people notice that modern art became meaningless and poor once it was given all freedom. They prefer to look back at past masters to satisfy their taste.


All things considered, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. I am inclined to think that it is very important to have art freedom as it lets people express themselves and improves art.

It can also be seen that the youngest women (16-24 years old) and the oldest ones (over 75 years old) spent twice less time (or even less) exercising than men of these ages (114,1 minutes vs. 282,2 minutes and 10 minutes vs. 29,2 minutes respectively). The only example against this tendency can be spotted in the 5th two figures standing for the everage amount of time men and women of the age 55-64 years spent exercising: in that case the time dedicated to sport of women (55,4 minutes) was slightly bigger than that of men (52,7 minutes).
The second most prominent trend is that the average time people spent doing sport in England in 2012 was constantly reducing with their age raising. There is again one contr-example: 65-74 years old men dedicated more of their time (about 60 minutes) than 55-64 years old men (just above 50 minutes).

Modern technologies are really developed. With the help of them people can do everything on the internet and such progress cause a huge problems for a films or songs creators. First of all, musicians and producers do not get their money and have a lot of costs. If creators lose money, they would not have an opportunity to pay for actors and other people, who were involved in the process of film, clip or song making. Secondary, investors are not interested in activities, where they pay a huge amounts of money and other people just “steal” their production and money. Investors prefer to avoied such spheras where pirates can use special programmes and steal everything so easy.
Another significand reason why pirates are dangerous for industry of entertainment and producers or musitions is that actors or singers do not be inspired to take part in activities after that they will not get respect, glorial. Pirates usually copy film or songs in a bad quality. because of this other can not estimate the work of singers or actors and tne do not want to work in this situation.

Musicians and producers suffer considerable losses as a consequences of it. Some people think that it is normal to use pirate copies. Their opponents assume that these illegal actions should be punished. I claim there must be punishment for illegal copying and sharing music and video materials.

In my opinion, people should be punished for distributing pirate copies. Firstly, people who worked on a particular project lose their profit because of it. Secondly, it is dishonest that people who make illegal copies of music and films start to distribute it and turn it into a business. They gather money from people who buy this copies inspite of the fact that they have not made any contribution into the product. What is more, musicians and film producers need money to develop their activity and to get more opportunities but it is impossible as far as the profit from their products is too low because of the pirate copies which people download from the Internet.

Some people disagree with this point of view. They believe that downloading illegal copies of films and music should not be punished at all. From their point of view, people are not so rich to pay for every film they want to watch and for every song they want to listen. Besides, people assume that companies or groups which produce films or music have enough money to go on creating new ideas.

To sum up, the problem under consideration is multiple-valued. So many men, so many minds. I am inclined to think that distribution of pirate copies and downloading files from the internet instead buying should be punished. However, different points of view have the right to exist.

Now, in the world there is a democration and all cuntries should let people to be fee and do what they want. If one country restrict creative artists to do something, it will have some problems because rest of the countries will against of this.


On the other hand, such activities as paintings and pictures, writing articles or books should be do according to the laws of the country, because they can destroy the ideas of other people. In addition, bad things should not be showed to children or religion people, for example recently groups of women has sung the song against the government in the church and has destoyed the ideas of religion people, who have been there.


In conclusion, I agree with that creative artists should have the freedom to express their own points of view.

First of all, it is the average length of life. Japan is well-known for its long-living people , and that is why the proportion of them is expected to excud 25% by 2040. However, the economic situation has not always been so brilliant , moreover, it was much worse there then in Europe and America , so the number was relatively low until the expected acute rise in 2030. Also, that is due to the fact that more children are born in Japan , and as a result, they take up some 'space' in the generations division. 
Secondly, it is social policy that afects the quality of life. After the introduction of state insurance and pensions both in the USA and Sweden , more elderly people were able to afford suitable medical treatment, housing or other benefits. Another option is the decline in the number of children per family. More and more young people decline to start a family later anf have only 1 or 2 offsprings , and this tendency will certainly bring about the growth of the proportion of the elderly people, as those born in 1975 are 65 years old by 2040.
To draw a conclusion, we may say that not only social or economic tendencies , but also government policies might cause certain changes in social proportions , consequently, these policies and tendencies should be accurately governed.

Nations should reduse the total amount of imported products. I totally agree with this station, because it is necessary for countries to have their own food products.

The quality of nutrition has great impact on people’s health. Different type of food are exported from many countries. Goods can be failed during a long transportation, for this reason a lot of companies use special medicines or pesticides. For example, farmers make special corn with harmful substances for chicken. Consuquently, birds grow faster and their meat can be saved in refrigerators for a long time. Moreover, this product is a reason for people’s illneses. Thus, governments should stopped buying products from another countries and try to start their own producing.

The independence in economic side is important for every country. The government should provide minimal amount of food for each person. In addition, there are some situations that proved the importance of own producing food for countries. For instance, economic crysic when people need in new job places. In this situation it will be right to build new factories for making food products. In this way, country can avoid critical situations for their economy and allow people to have a job.

In conclusion, I personally think that every country should improve conditions of producing food. People need to have reliable government, which can help and protect their in every situation.

It is true, that we should punish people, who illegally copy and share films or music, because it is property and property rights should be protected strictly. However, sometimes a producer of some content leaves it in open access and anyone can download or share it. Consequently, sharing and copying it will not be illegal.
Moreover, another question arises – should we blame or punish consumers of “pirate” content? Should we blame peasants, who get food from Robin Hood? They didn’t steal anything and they had no aim to violate the laws. In addition, practically all modern scientific theories are based on “rationality” of an individual person. Therefore, if he dounloads file of something else, which is in open access on the internet for free instead of buying it for some amount of money (Modern films’ and music album’s cost is rather high, that is another reason why people dounload “pirate” content), should we blame him for rationality.

Almost 90 per cent of young people of the age 18-29 and 73 per cent of those surveyed who are 30-49 years old use this social network. It is also widely used by respondents who are older than 50: more than a half of people of age groups of 50-64 and 65+ are active users of Facebook.
As for two other sites which were analyzed, the survey shows that they are less popular than Facebook. For most of the groups the percentage is relatively small. It is especially obvious for Instagram: it accounts for 25 per cent of respondents of the age group of 30-49 yars old and 11 and 5 per cent of those of groups 50-64 and 60+, accordingly. However, a distinctive feature of this site is that approximately half of the young aged less than 30 use it. Whereas the percantage of the users of LindIn is more equally distributed: no more than 31 per cent for each group.

Firstly, I agree that this is a big problem in these industries. Let’s start from fact that I’m a huge fan of music and cinema. Usually, I’m buying music on I-tunes, or in any other internet shop. And of course, usually I am going to the cinema, with mu friends, or with my girlfriend or maybe even solo. So It’s normal for me to spend money for these kinds of entertainment. And I understand that my money are very important for musician and producers, But on the other hand, I have two examples. First – I have been known a lot of people, who is not able to spend money for this. It’s people whose life is harder than mine in many ways, especially in financial possibilities. And I understand them extremely well, when they downloading ‘illegal’ copies of films in the Internet. And I have an example of my father. He is a musician, and I know very well, that outcome of public concerts in many times bigger, than a little percentage of disk sales, because the main part of it goes to producers. So I prefer to separate musicians and producers. And as my opinion, amount of money losing is highly overrated. Financially successful films always have a good outcome, despite of any factors. So problem is very overrated.

There are more urgent problems that cannot be ignored such as poverty and environmental issues. I do not agree with this opinion.
First if all, our planet runs out of fossils and resources such as oil or water. We will need some other source of them very soon. Trees are cut everywhere for making goods for people so this process cannot be stopped. However, we know that trees are the source of oxygeon -- the thing we cannot breath without. That means we eventually make ourselves lose the most important thing in life. Therefore we need to explore the space: we look for a place where we can leave some day, but for now no human being do not even reach the Marce. People should spend much time and money on developing technologies to make it happen. Otherwise, some day we will have no place to go.
Secondly, problems with environment are too large to be solved. No one can force every man on the Earth use sun-charged cars instead of oil, for example. There are also a lot of trash everywhere and we even have no place to put it.
Furthemore, goverments and societies over the world do a lot of work for poor people: social programs that include giving money or jobs, free food in churches and special places for homeless people to sleep.
The main point is that it does not mean there are enough money for these problems. However, space exploring is too important sphere to be taken money from and people can work out other ways to solve them: to decrease sallaries of politicians, for example.
In conclusion I would like to say, poverty and environmental issues are important and large problems too, but they are not the only problems that should be solved. Space exploring will help us to survive so goverments should pay attention to it too.",6

The negative influence of modern gadgets can be easily noticied in everyday life. For example, increasing number of people suffer of reducing eyesight clearing due to the widespread of smartphones or laptops. People spend hours starring at them without noticing the harm. Another vital problem is obesity. Nowadays people become less and less active because of various means of transport or distant entertainment such as Internet. The need to move disappears when you can live a full life without leaving your house. 

On the other hand, there are many technologies developing to fight these problems. Firstly, there is brilliant gadget that helps us to control physical activity – a fitness brasetel. This little thing makes activities more exiting and useful. Secondly, many of the hi-tech corporations are trying to reduce the eye damage of the screens, for example, there are many readers with electronic technology that is much less harmful than ordinary screens.

It is even more relevant nowadays, when the amount of crimes rises every year in our country. There are many arguements about ways of lowering the level of crimes in the society, so let's look at both opinions.
Some people think, that the most effective way of dealing with criminal problem is giving longer prison sentences. They say that it makes people more afraid of the punishment for the crimes they could commit, so in this case fear can prevent crimes.
They also state that isolating all the criminals from the society for a long period of time is much more effective, because If all the criminals cannot commit crimes, the problem is solved, so prison is a perfect measure of social safety. Finally they say that prison can teach people how to become healthy part of the society, so schools and education in prisons can help people to socialise after leaving the prison.
But there is another opinion. There are people who think that prolonging prison sentences can just make the whole situation worse. Firstly, the prison cannot make people better. There are no proper system of prison education in our country, so people in prisons just do not get opportunity to take any kind of courses. Secondly, the chance of becoming part of the criminal world is much higher in prison, especially for young people, Thirdly, just isolating criminals from the society does not stop other people from commiting new crimes.
As for me, I strongly believe that prison can niether stop people from commiting crimes, nor make people better citizens. Prison just ruines people's lives. It is well shown in Shalamov's stories or the tale of Showshenk by Steven King. People in prison can just commit new crimes, because there is no other way for them to live. To conclude, Though there is an opinion that main measure of dealing with crime issue are prisons, I so not agree. I sill believe that there are many other social ways to deal with this problem",7

Moreover, junk, which all people and many different  factories have, damage oceans, rivers, forests, and it is cause, why many people have many king of problem with their health, and, also, many organisms and animals died.

Some tend to belive that the best way is longer prison sentence. While others argue that there are better ways. Both view have their pros and cons. Increasing prison sentence can prevent some people from doing crime as they will know about risk of spending most of their lifes in prison. But there is another side of  this solution. First of all, prosins will take more money. From country budget as prison has to spent more on every prisoner. Second and may be even more important. Criminals will go for a higher crimes to avoid prison. For example, theift can kill a man to avoid being caughted. Last problem is connects with the first one. Government will ned to built more prisons to keep all criminals. It also have money from budget. But do we have after native ways? Yes, there are some other possible silutions to prevent crime. First one is reducing number of unemployment people. A lot of people go for crime just because they do not have something do it. Giving them job can prevent them from going for crime. Second approach is to start with children. Most of the crimals start doing illegal brings from the childhood. It is very important for parents of trachers, child phycologists to make sure that one do not got for a wrong rond. Of course, there are many other small steps that can help. In my opinion, longer prison sentences certainly is not the right solution, so we have to concentrate on alternative approaches and combine them for better results.

And we should seach the other way to cope with its problem, but introduction laws to reduce the amount of using airbuses is not suitable for modern society. First of all, airbuses are the most convenient, cheapest and fasten kind of transport. And if governments introduce laws that reduce the number of air travel for business and leisure, it could cause social disaster, “bum” among people. The history gives us a lot of examples of radical reforms and many of them leaded to awful consequences. Moreover, there are a lot manufactories, factories that provide all kinds of pollution more than other things. I mean a great number of waste, toxic components of their technologies. And there are a lot of examples when owners of these factories do not buy necessary equipment that can help to avoid ecological problems. And scientists did many researches in this area and said that airzoles which are using in our everyday life all over the world contribute a great to air pollution (about 15% according to the results of researches). To sum up, I want to say that, of course, using airbuses a lot of time has its drawbacks and has a negative influence. But we should not forget about the main factors of air pollution and global waming at all; toxic wastes of factories, using some things in our everyday life. And people should try to cope with it without introduction unsuitable laws in the sphere of social life.

Some people claim that those athlets who do it, have to be forbidded to take part in the competitions for some time, while others believe that such people should be banned forever. In the following essay I will examine both points of view and express my personal opinion.
It is certainly the case that in present times the development of chemistry and pharmacy has made various kinds of drugs availible in the market. Most of them are, of course, illegal for the use of sportsmen. However, very often some drug is put into the category of forbidden only after some precedent has occured. It means that an athlete could take it without knowing he isn't supposed to, but still he can be punished for doing it. Some people might argue that, saying that a person has to be perfectly aware of the list of banned components in drugs, nevertheless, I am convinced that new rules appear every day and they are quite hard to be predicted. That is why I find that limiting sportsmen for their whole lives is unfair.
What is more, I find such kind of punishment to be too harsh. All people make mistakes in their lives and everybody deserves forgiveness and a second chance. Thus, very often a person who is left without an opportunity to return to his career in some period of time falls into depression and finds it hard to recover. I strongly believe that a 1-5 year period is enough for an athlete to realize what he has done and not do this ever again. My opponents may object, claiming that illegal drugs usage in professional sport is a very serious crime and people who are convinced of it must take their punishment, however I find that it is a simple cheating which certainly can be forgiven.
Nevertheless, it must be true to say that everything depends on a particular situation. For instance, if an athlete has already been accused of taking illegal drugs before or if he takes part in some extremelly famous world competition and breaks this ground rules, the punishment might be heavier. Although I can agree that due to these or other circumstances a person can be resticted from competing, I still don't think that he or her should be banned forever. 
To conclude, it is evident that this issue appears to be highly controversial. A lot of people see illegal drugs usage in sport as a crime of a major importance. Others, on the contrary, find it not so serious. In my personal opinion, some measures of punishment must exist, however, they shouldn't be so significant.

Today artists have the freedom, but sometimes government can restrict their ideas. I am convinced that creative artists should not be restricted.
In my opinion, politics and art do not have the same reasons. The function of government is regulation of social, economical and political relationships in society. Art is another world that gives up an opportunity to think and live as we wish in our fantasies.
If creative persons forget their freedom to express their ideas, we will not see the new kinds and trends of art. Modern life is very dynamic, it changes very fast. Yes, we have many wonderful pictures of 18 century, we can listen to classical music and watch old films. But, despite of it, we need more genius compositions.
We know that some of modern songs, films, cartoons and pictures have the signals of revolution. Power afraid of this trend, because modern art can influence the society more then government. Without any doubt, sometimes it can be useful. Power corrupts. Art is indicator of people's opinion, and people can influence government.
Freedom is a criteria of democracy. Democracy is the main idea of modern life, that is why today everybody can express his ideas the way he wants.
But some people have an opposite viewpoint. They sure that modern painters and singers are very free, that is why their expression is ugly and can influence children and polite people bad way. I think that these people are afraid of changes in modern world.
Art is long, life is short, that is why freedom should be the main criteria of modern art, because we need the new ways of expression.

It is undenaible that it has some controversial aspects. I agree, with this statement, that nowadays such actions as download pirate copies should be punished.
Firstly, it is not unfair and unrespectfully tp get some products without paying some fee. Musicians, producers and others people of art do their own job and should be paid for it. these represents of such work spend their time to create really important and beatiful things in our world. So, we, listeners, viwer and so one show respect their work and help in their ways. Last but not the least, todays world is world of money where the smallest jod is paid. No one want to get nothing for time, brain power which were using for creation something new. Why we shouldn’t pay for film or song? We really should to do this. Because fees could be used to help poor people in Africa, or, maybe, to create the new film or song.
In this way, I would like to say that in our modern society and word people should respect each others and their works. One the thinks which help we can express our feeling is to pay some amount of money for thankful and help in future development. Buying illegal pirate copies we encourage those, who are the crimes and with these actions we make our society more badly and give an awful example for our children and descendants.

The similar situation is present in other non-English speaking countries. I think that it is provoked by a number of reasons. Firstly, the quality of American and British movies is undoubtfuly higher and people choose the best. Hollywood has a rich history of cinematograph and people there khow how to produce films well and earn money. The technologies there are more developped.
The second reason is that English is an international language and unify people all over the world. Should governments give more financial support to local film industries? We know that Russian government try to support our producers. For example, ""Fond Kino"" gives a lot of money to produce Russian films and I think it is a good way to stimulate Russian film-makers. On the other hand, we can see also persons who получает this finacial support and the films they product. Its quality does not grow (may be the reason is that they want just to earn miney and corruption); producers who have been appreciated by the world (for example, Alexander Sokurov) can not produce their films in Russia and look for other investment. The facts make people disappoint in Russian movies and doubt in justice of fond's decisions, that's why people does not to bring them miney in cinema and just to watch their films. This is the last evident reason of unpopularity of locally produced films.
To conclude, I think that government has to support local producers. That will motivate small but talented producers to create good films and will develop lical film indystry.",6

It is very comfortable and really fast: with the help of air travel you can achieve your final destination in shorter period than you could do it about 100 years ago. But there is the other side of air travelling. Planes produce the pollution of the air and many other deseases like warming atmosphere. That is wht some scientists say that we need some rules introduced by government, which are connected with the airtravel in different purposes.
As for me, I think that global warming is one of the most important problems for humanity in the 21st century. Firstly, there are so huge amount of risks for people's health and lifes connected with the result of the global warming. For example, it is not a secret that global warming contributes such changes as coast lines movings and climate changes. So, as the airplanes have significant impact on this factor, governments should decline this risks by creating new laws for air companies and people who travel a lot. In my opinion, it will be very useful if our government install some amount brouds for travelers.
What is more, everyone knows that airports are never situated in the cities, but near them. One of the main reasons of this is that negative effect of airplanes is still one of the common dangers mentioned by specialists. Providing air pollution, air travelling should be more reasonable, I think. However, governments should be alarmed by this danger for people, animals and plants. It is in competention of governments to decline negative effect of air travelling by producing special laws to control air travelling.
In conclusion, I would like to underline that travelling by planes has it's dangerous effect on our health, for example, get lags make us feel bored and tired and crushes our biological watches. So, new rules and laws introduced by government are really needed today.

Anyway there is an argue on this topic, so there are people who believe in other alternative ways of reducing crime which are better in their opinion. The first group of people arguing on this topic, think that all those who commit crimes should get their corresponding prison sentence. If the crime is hard, the person must get the longest prison sentence, otherwise after leaving the prison this person will be able to make the crime once again. So the prison sentence should be as long as the crime maker deserves or he will not understand the extent in which he was wrong. Increasing the prison sentence will reduce the number of people who are able to make some kind of crime, because they would not like to be given such a long prison sentence. So people who know what is expected to them will think before committing crime. Nevertheless there are people who believe in existence of other ways of reducing crime that can be more liberal for person that have committed a crime. For example one of these ways can be a work of a psycologist with a person who was wrong in his actions. So if person do not understand that his action is bad and wrongit, the psycologist will explain it.  In my opinion the first group of people is right, so I think the longer prison sentence will reduce crime, but not any alternative and liberal ways. People who commit crimes are abnormal, their psychics is not the same as normal people's. So any alternative way of reducing crime will not be as efficient, as heavy one for the person which is able to commit a crime.    . ",7

However, several eminent scientists are considering that we are becoming too successful, that our way of life has a serious impact on ecosystem of the Earth. Air pollution and global warming are the obvious examples of this affecting. According to this, decision are divided into two main groups: some people think that air travel should be reduced by government, others believe that it is beneficial to our society. Let us discuss the pros and cons of it. It is my personal strong belief, that our travel is necessary for humanity. First of all, it is the fastest way of transport. While planning business trips or vacations, millions of people prefer to use planes, because there is a good combination of speed quality and price in modern air transport. Moreover, safety is also a great characteristic of our travelling. The possibility of air crashing is about one chance of million flying miles, whis is the smallest quantity among all modern ways of transport. At least but not at least planes are able to cover a lot of  miles, including oceans, mountains and so on. It is nearly impossible to travel from Sydney to London without using our transport. In spite of sitting in comfortable chair, you should spend a couple of weeks on ship, then using longway trains and so on. To my mind, it is not so convenient. On the other hand, some people think that it is harmful for our planet to use air travelling. However, I believe that there are a lot of more damaging for our Earth human activities. For example, the air is also polluted by cars and fabrics, the sail and water are polluted by deforestation and using pesticides in agraculture. So we should focus our attention on other important environmental issues, which is not such beneficial to our society. To sum it up, humas find a right balance in using damaging for our planet resources, but we should start from some more critical problems, then reducing the amount of air travel.

From the chart it becomes evident that younger Americans are much more involved in social network than their aged counterparts. Facebook holds the leading positions as more than a half among each age has an account there, nevertheless Instagramm and LinkedIn have found their niche groups as well.
Both Facebook and Instagramm rely greatly on the young as 87% and 53% are presented in these social networks respectively. As the age goes up presence of this age group members in the network gradually diminishes (for Facebook) or drastically slumps if we have a closer look at Instagramm: the percentage of 30-49 years old users is twice less compared to 18-29 group. The statistics for Linkedin is quite remarkable: albeit it is not very popular nationwide, it still attracts a significant share (31% and 30%) in the 30-49 and 50-64 age groups.
To sum it up, presence in the social network greatly relies on user’s age while network’s content defines it’s target audience as Instagramm is more youth-oriented, Facebook is used by almost everyone and LinkedIn is helpful for those who work.

Personally, I believe that a number of female and male students must be equal in the majority of universities. What is better for universities, to have equal numbers of people of the same gender, is a controversial issue worth discussing.
It is often argued that the proportion of male students should be equal to the proportion of girls. Firstly, it would be perfect, if every boy can talk with another girl. The result would be the following: every student has a lot of attention and communication to his person. Secondly, a teacher can practice his or her sociable skills in order to get on well with the students of both genders.
In addition, some parents think that a faculty with an equal number of girls and boys is a good opportunity for their daughters and sons to get married. If a male student manages to have excellent relationships with a female student in university, then in the future she will have a brilliant chance to become his wife. Moreover, at present the women are fewer than men. So it can cause the decrease of the population in the case if a number of girls are bigger. The demografic situation can be worse because of this fact.
Nowadays it is a very important question which depends on the opinion of everyone. I consider that it is much better when all universities can have an equal number of the students of the both genders on every faculty because all students become more sociable due to communication with each other and because it can effect demografic situation in a positive way.

This is not only about charity, politics, medicine or surviving and overcoming environmental disasters, but also about business. Some people claim that the strategy of opening new branches of well-known highly-influential companies in developing and third-world countries is one of the best ways to fight against unemployment, whereas others assume this method to be rather useless. I share the first opinion.    There are some arguments supporting my point of view. First of all, by giving an opportunity of such employment to local workers is actually a whole cluster of decisions, as with this chance people may also receive extra education for their occupation and other perks such as health insurance, which is especially important for them. Moreover, extention to poorer countries usually creates lots of blue collar offers, not only white collar once, which would have more interest in such countries, as it's often factories that's being constructed and opened in developing states.    However, there are those complaining about this strategy being a complete non-sence. They believe that such development may bring managing problems because such programmes are usually performed in remote places. And that distance, as supposed, has its effect on the final cost of the outcome product, which is a result of higher logistic expenses. Still, from my point of view those extra payments don't play a big role in the final cost. That is because labour in developing countries is way cheaper than in developed once, which means that an outcome is practically the same. As a result, it is not only the citizens who benefit from such programmes, but also the companies themselves. Taking everything into consideration, the advantages of such trends are quite obvious and are above any arguments. It is unquestionable that everybody gets the best from these deals, so why not turning a rare practice into a common practice full of benefits for both sides?",7

Firstly, the main reason, why behavior of coping, sharing and downloading illegal files has to be punished, is that hard-work of producers and musicians do not bring them enough money.
For example, people who do others jobs have stable salary for part of work, wich they do and if their boss does not give enough money salary for them, they will change their jobs.
On the other hand, the high oppotinities for download these files allows poor people watch this movies and lisen this music too.
Secondly, people who buying the original version pay their own money for it and other people have to do the same thing. If people do not buy the original movie of film, they break roles of morality, because if one person pay money for thing, the other person have to pay for this too or she or he will be a thif.

The general trend is clear: over time, it becomes less convinient for people to use Facebook. Also, the main reasons for using Facebook are sharing photo and video materials, as well as receiving updates and seeing funny posts.
After taking a closer look, in March 2012 over 140 million of users were using Facebook on their desktops, however, just in one year this number fell to under 60 million. The numbers for mobile devices also fell drastically: from about 140 million in 2012 to less than 100 million in 2013. In terms of reasons for using this social network, 54% of women and 39% of men share photos and videos with it. At the same time, only 35% of female users and 25% of males learn about ways to help others through Facebook. Receiving updates is the equally important reason to use Facebook for 39% of both men and women, but 43% of women like to see funny posts there, compared to 35% of men who like to do the same.
Overall, Facebook becomes less popular among users, and reasons for using it are slightly different for two genders.",7

To my mind, there should not be official restrictions from our government, but there should be inner moral rules about what somebody can or cannot do.
Firstly, I have to say that nobody can stop our imagination creating different ideas, and government restrictions will not make us do it. They can only make some types of arts illegal, but it does not mean that these types of arts will die out. If government gives us freedom to express our ideas, there will be more orginized events and festivals. In this way government will show that it trusts it's nation.
But I should notice that some types of arts cannot be shown to the children, because it may hurt their feelings or minds or be really unacceptable for this little age. I want to say that we should protect young consiousness from harmfull effect.
Besides, I believe that expressing and watching are different things, that we cannot combine in our discussion. I guess that everybody has a right to express what he thinks or feels, but everytime a person should remember that he can upset his relatives or friends. Everybody has different views on music, politics, art. We should be tollerant and respect an opposite point of view.
To sum it all up I want to say that everybody has to dicide for himself if he can express something, which is inside of him, or cannot. For me, it is more important to have inner restrictions than have useless government rules which try to control our modern art.

This situation may cause worries among local film productions, as movies they make often don't get a lot of popularity. Some people believe that governments should financially support local movie industries. I totally agree with this point of view.

First of all, people's choice is caused by a lot of different factors, if some movie is getting more popular than others, it probably means that it has better video and audio effects, visual picture is more entertaining or the plot better catches attention of the person watching the movie. However,there are a lot of movies which made huge sums of money just by using better commercial methods. Such films become popular before they are even available to watch. People wait for them and go to see them, even though they don't always get positive reviews. At the same time a local film can be totally ignored by people just because producers don't have enough money to advertise it. Financial support from the government can help solve this problem and give a chance to really good films made by small movie companies.

Moreover, it is important to support and develop culture of each country. At the age of the Internet things become easier to find, it means both that people from other countries can see movies from America and England, and that people from the US or UK can, for instance, watch shows from India or any other country, but the problem is that English is spoken in a lot of places and it is not that difficult to understand the story of the film, while language barrier makes it hard to watch local movies from other countries. Translating them into English or at least providing English subtitles can significantly help, but it once again comes to money. The budget of local movies is really small and they can't afford to spend more on the translation of the movie. Governments could have offered free traslation of the movies to best local film industries, so the movies they make could become famous in other parts of the world.

To sum up, I believe that there are two main reasons for British and American movies being so popular all over the world. A lot of people can speak English, but not many can understand languages from other world regions, which makes it is easier for movies from the US or UK to spread. Also local industries don't have a lot of money to advertise their movies. Government can help solve both of these problems.",7

To begin with, it is obvious that various kinds of mass media account for the increasing number of young culprits.The research shows that young people are particularly vulnerable and it leads to their psychological deformation as they imitate the behaviour of their favourite characters. The Internet and TV often propogate the temptuous image of criminals which is connected with a great number of merits, such as luxurious life and respect of other people. This shapes the wrong attitude of young people towards crime and its consequences and replaces the true values of humanism and hard labour. Moreover, deprived childhood and poor living conditions also contribute in the committing crimes. Young people often have limited opportunities and have to strive for any source of income to provide financial support for the family. Usually unemployment or lack of skills hinders their chances to earn for living. Consequently, this makes young people commit crimes.

Some urgent measures should be taken in order to tackle this problem. First of all, parents should eliminate any danger that comes from mass media. It is necessary to control the content of TV shows and serials and sometimes restrict the access to some sources. There are special controling programs which should be used by parents on a massive scale. What is more, it would be useful to organise special events in schools or universities in order to make young people reveal the adverse consequences of delinquent behaviour. For example, teachers can invite former criminals to share their negative experience and the outcome of committing crimes.

To sum up, the increase of crimes committed by young people is an alarming problem which requires complex measures in order to eradicate it.",7

It is obvious that transportation of manufactured goods is nearly the same by both of these means, 12% of machinery is transported by rail, and only 2% by road. The most striking fact is that less transported goods by rail are non-metallic minerals and machinery by road. What is more, it is seen, that the amount of transported chemicals are also close as manufactured goods.

The thing is that young people in the developing world have much more freedom than earlier.
In addition to this, the world has become much more violent than it used to be. Firstly, teenagers and young adults today are opressed by mass media, especially the Internet. Social networks have become an important part of everyone’s everyday life, thus it is easy to manipulate people. As long as youngsters do not have enough experience, it is easier to influence their behaviour and benefit their naiveness.
Secondly, there is a trend to a rise in amount of violence presented in videogames and films, TV programmes and news. As a consequence, youngsters take violence in everyday life as granted and do not consider committing a crime to be a great problem.
Moreover, drugs have become one of the greatest problems we face today. Young people easily become a victim of illegal business, thus becoming a puppet in the hands of real criminals.
Nevertheless, teachers and parents can help their children cope with these problems by educating them from the very early age. I believe the stories about their own experience will actually help to imagine what can crimes result in. What is more, it is important that youngsters knew how are criminals punished.
To sum up, young people today need to get much more attention from adults. It is of utmost importance to shape a strong consciousness as early as it is possible in order to prevent the growth in number of young criminals and further achieve a visible decline.

Firstly, this essay will focus on the ground for such a tendency, and, secondly, it will provide several guidelines that can be used to tackle this problem.
To begin with, the main cause for criminal activity of young people is the growth of violence in the social media and sphere of entertainment, to be mor precise, cinema and videogames. Being involved into virtual reality full of cruelty and harrassment, the youth transfer this perception to the real world. If the boundaries between the virtual activity and social life become blur, an individuality does not care anymore whether his or her behaviour is acceptable according to the norms and values that are established in the society. There is a convincing evidence based on the latest research of psychologists that those people who are addicted to video games often see their own life in the same way. The whole world is just a level of a game for them. That is why they can commit robbery, steal a car or even murder a person they dislike without awarness of the consequences. The second significant reason of the growth of youth criminality is the lack or the absence of social support both of the society and of their family. It is well known that a child with deprived background has much higher probablity of becoming a criminal than his peer from caring family of the middle class. Growing up and having to survive in indifferent or even hostive world these people try to reach their goals with any means possible.
Turning to the changes that can be implemented in order to minimalise youth criminality, first and foremost, it is is essential to work on educational campaings raising awareness of how dangerous getting involved into video games is. The second point is supportins traditional norms and values. They can also provided both through educational institutions, although the upbringing in the family is more essential in that case. Not only are the relations in the family significant for shaping the mindset, but they also play a significant role in psychological outcast and comfort of a person. If there are people an individuality can rely on in any life situation, he is unlikely to turn to activities that reject social rules.
Summing up, both the school and the family are supposed to be effective tools in reducing the amount of crimes commited by the yough. They should concentrate on deeper interaction with each individuality, its mindset and life perception and have a proper influence on him.",8

The most significant fall we can see on the bars of South Asia. Total amount of children without access to primary education have fallen from about 32,7 millions to 9,9. It is possibly connected with the economical grows of this region.
Another noticable thing is that the amount of girls in each area was bigger in 2000 then the number of boys. However, they were almost equal or at least much clother in 2012.

That leads to the overuse of air means of transport which causes air pollution and global warming effect. Some people believe that there is nothing serious in thousands of planes in the sky. Others think that it is a great threat to the environment and we have to cut down the amount of air travel. As far as I am concerned the plane is the fastest way of travelling in the world. For example, it takes just a few hours to fly from Moscow to Saint-Petersburg compared with 10 hours wasted in a car or a train. Moreover, it is much more convinied and less dangerouse than going by bus. Sometimes it is the only possible method to move from one place to another. Finally, today there are government programmes which make the airlines companies install “green” engines in planes in order to reduce the amount of exhausted gases going out in the atmosphere and, as the result, cut down air pollution. On the other hand, not so many airlines use environment friendly equipment these days because it costs enough and companies have no profit from it. Furthermore, there are a lot of extremely old planes which are 20 or more years old. All in all, these factors make us think twice abut the introduction of special laws not to reduce only the amount of air travel but to cut down the amount of waste produced by one plane. To sum up, it is strongly believed that the number of air travelling as an essential part of the word infrastructure. Trying to block it will lead to terrible consequences for the world economy, culture and other spheres of human activity. However, we should do our bets to make the plane not become the factor which destroys our planet.

Many people claim that this money would better be spent on some social issues (such as fight with poverty) or environment problems. Personally, I disagree with this point of view.
To begin with, investing money in space exploration is also investing money in the future itself. Who knows, perhaps we will be forced to leave Earth, and space exploration programs might come in handy in such scenarios. Furthermore, space is all around us, so I suppose we should know a lot of things about it and all the other possible variants for relocation.
Secondly, space exploration may bring us new sources of different resources, or even get us some new materials we have never heard of! Space is immensly big, so there might be something interesting and useful out there, so why not explore it?
On the other hand, those who what governments to stop space exploration programs and spend all that money on other problems can be understood. First, space programs can result in nothing, so they might seem like a waste of money. Second, these programs are really costly, so a lot of money is being pumped into the sphere, without knowing the result, and if the result is not satisying enough, people (whose taxes are the specdings being pumped) may get angry.
Overall, I believe that these space exploration programs should not be stopped. Even though they might seem like a waste of money, it is always good to be ahead of your opponents, and space exploration programs may give such an opportunity.",6

In modern world the problem of criminality among teenagers became sharp question and triggered a lot of discussions. In this essay I’d like to reflect different views on this problem from the point of its development and the solution of the problem.
First of all, many people say that the reason of teenage criminality is the development of internet and technology, which allows youngsters buy guns and cold-weapons without any control. Moreover, the growth of popularity of violent content in TV-stream, movies and computer games make children copy vicious behavior and demonstrate aggression. As addition, children became more vulnerable before the face of anxiety and loneliness, which trigger a lot of problems with communication and the desire to be cruel and violent to people as a result.
The question of how to prevent such behavior is raised on the governmental level nowadays, but teachers and parents should obviously take part in solving this problem. First of all, parents should spend more time with their children to know their interests and intentions. What is more, they should help children to move through their personal doubts, frustration and other psychological problems to low down the level of aggression. As for the teachers, they should solve the conflicts between students in peaceful way and conduct debates and team-building activities. Not only should adults teach children maths and grammar, they should also teach them how to be tolerant and keep calm.
All in all, the problem of teenage criminality have its roots in the indifference of adults, who let the internet to be the best and the only friend of their kids. Every adult, no matter whether has he children or not, is to contribute in peace and stability of this world.",7

To begin with that they can opoen new, unic school where artists will rise these sucseses and develop not only knowledge about this subject, but also talents.

Moreover, speaking from the prospectives of employees working in such corporations, it is worth noting that the conditions do not correspond to standarts.

Hollywood is a place that lures all sorts of talented people who's main aim is to produce a hich quality product. So the first reason why people worldwide love American films is that the USA has a developed industry with passionate gifted prople. Secondly, British and American films provide viewers with all kind of representation they need. In films produced in those countries we can see people of different nationalities, with different religious and cultural beliefs, etc. Moreover, there are a lot of British films that show people that a different from others and it makes viewers inspired. People love watch movies with characters who are just like them or have the same issues. On the contrary, local films mostly show just an average citizen of a country which is not only not interesting for local people but is also not so appealing to foreighners who might not understand local culture. Finally, as we have mentioned Hollywood, we should not also forget that films produced there cost a lot. Local companies producing films simply cannot afford to use visual effects, choose breathtaking locations or invite famous actors. That makes them less interesting to watch and thus less popular.
One possible solution that can make local films more popular is to provide film producing companies with financial support. It will help such companies forget about lack of money and make their wishes come true which will make films more exciting and complicated.
However, as far as I am concerned, governments should not give more financial support to local film companies. It is not that I am against the idea of financial support, it is just my firm belief that every country should do what it can do best and should not try to become successful in every sphere.",6

Obviously, it can cause some different problems. However, the item in topic seems to be a mixed blessing, as there are many reasons for this point.
Firstly, when child grows up, he creates his own world, with self point of view, self sight in the things and of course, with his own people – friends, and later, family. So, usually when both parents go out to work their children have their own families, or, at least, a partner. This item defines the following thing: our already not young child lives separated, in other words, far from his parents. This is the one reason. Secondly, also the obvious poin, is that when the child become older, some important things is appearing, such as education or job. This is why students or employees cannot spent a lot of time with close people, in particular, with their parents, because of general business. No need to say, it always causes problems. The first and the most dangerous if that old parents are staying alone. There are no one to help them with everyday issues, no one to care about them or, finally, to simply talk with them. So, old parent feel themselves lonely. The second problem is that because of spending less time with parents than in the past, children sometimes break good relationships between them and parents. Senior people see their falt in the lack of attention to their children, and for second one this is the main argument: they do not look well after them, and this is the root of all their life problems. Sad, but true. In conclusion it should be said, that everyone is free to choose their own way in life, and to choose, how to communicate with parents. But ethics rules warn us not to forget about our parents, because this is our first and most important family.

In my opinion, there are indeed quite a range of specific health problems that spring from our sometimes malformed modern lifestyle. As such, we suffer from heart diseases a lot more than our ancestors because of increased level of everyday stress and lack of physical activities; we are at risk of various kinds of cancer due to bad ecological conditions: obesity becomes widespread, since our nutrition culture is far from healthy: and so on.

Despite what has been said, there are ways to reduce, if not get rid of, such problems. We need to remember that not the technologies themselves are to blame, but rather our own ignorance and laziness. Modern city life is indeed stressful, however, advanced urban planning technologies allow us to reduce noise levels, traffic jams, and improve air condition. Industry does cause significant damage to the environment, but it is with more advanced technology that we create environmental-friendly production processes and use clean energy sources. In the end, without technological progress there would have been no modern medicine, which allowed developed countries to increase mean lifespawn more than twofold since XIX century.

As our society is developing alongside with technologies we use, it becomes more obvious that the progress is not to be feared. Each new generation becomes more educated than its precessors, and all of those bizarre myths, such as that microvave radiation leads to cancer or LD-monitors are especially bad for our sight, go away. I personally believe that further technological advance is the only way for humanity to overcome the global problems the world is facing nowadays, even if some of them originated from use of less complicated technology.

Nowadays, the crime rates among youngsters are higher than they have ever been before. However, the situation can be changed for the better. In this essay, I will define the possible causes of the current situation and discuss solutions to this issue.
To start with, modern teenagers are exposed to violence everyday. Constant reports about murders and wars have made violence become a part of our lives, and it no longer seems to be something outstanding. Secondly, crimes and murders play a large role in the modern culture, being shown in practically every computer game, film or TV show. Both factors mentioned make young people perceive crime as something conventional, something that is possible to be commited by anyone. Lastly, there are not so many teenagers who are well aware of the modern laws and what kind of punishment follows a theft, for instance.

In order to change the situation, numerous measures need to be taken. First of all, awareness of law and punishment should be raised. This could be done by organizing special classes at schools. Moreover, teachers, having noticed alarming behaviour of some sort, should contact the child's parents to discuss and prevent the possible problems that might occur. Secondly, with the children being more preoccupied with extracarricular activities there would be less time for them to break the law. To achieve that, parents should listen carefully to what their children are interested in to try and provide them with an opportunity to dedicate themselves to a hobby of their liking. Lastly, a more global step should be taken. So as to shift the way crime is thought of, our culture is to be changed. It is easy to make money on violence on the screens, but it also leads to certain negative consequences to be dealt with.
To sum up, crime among young people is a problem that needs to be solved. And this can only be done by taking all the measures possible. Personally, I believe that occupying children with something of their interest is a great thing to start with.",8

This tendency is caused by a range of reasons and social problems, that still exist in our society. In this essay I would name several causes of juvenile crime and would try to point out measures that adults can be taken to diminish the number of crimes committed by teenagers.

Firstly, as consumption has a prestigious role in modern society, many teenagers, especially ones from poor and working class families, realize that their parents are not available to buy them expensive gifts, and choose breaking the law as means of getting money they need to buy expensive and cutting-edge gadgets and technical devices as well as fashionable clothes. Secondly, due to widespread availability of Internet access and popularity of different sources of information, which portray crimes in a positive light, as acts of courage and gaining respect among peers and among some specific social layers. There do exist a number of movies which depict criminals as rich and powerful men, living adventurous and dangerous lives. There are some video games, such as GTA or Mafia series, which provide an opportunity to play as a member of a gang as well.

However, there are some actions that can be made to improve the current situation with juvenile crime. First of all, teenagers should be aware of the punishment that awaits them if they break the law. They should realize that there is no ""Save/Load"" option in real life and that they take full responsibility for their unlawful deeds and actions. Besides, parents and school teachers should pay attention to adolescents' aspirations and help them to choose an suitable career, explaining them that the only way of achieving financial stablility and prosperity is getting education and hard work during all the life.

In conclusion I would like to say that there are several inevitable causes of growth in the number of crimes committed by young people, however, the current situation can be improved provided parents and teachers express the willing to help their children and students to live a decent and lawful life.",5

Some people claim that if is normal when both parents have full-time job, life in  modern world really costs a lot. Parents want a good education for their children. Good kindergardens and private schools provide qualified education but you should pay for it. Also, parents try to give their children interesting toys and modern technologies. Children’s cloth and toys are very expensive nowadays. Others believe that toys and gadjets are hod the most important things in the world, they claim that parents love and care are more important than money. I partly agree with this statement because parent’s patient and care are important but it will lose it’s weight it the family will not have money for food or cloth. There is one more reason why both parents can have full-time job. May be, they like to work and their job bring positive effect on society. If both parents are doctors or firemans they do important job for many people. People do choises all the time and working parents also should do them. If they want, they will find time lot both for their children and for the job.

It is a bad tendency and people should think what can be done with this increasing persantage. In this essay I will write some causes of this development and give solutions for overcomming them to parents and teachers.
First of all, many youngsters are trying to show their independency. They start to shout at parents, not to go to schools and so on, because they think that it ia a right way of independant living. Moreover, they star to committ some small crimes like poket lifting or shop robbery. I suppose that parents should speak with their children to stop this drammatic behaviour. They should clearly say what is right and what is wrong to do. Moreover, they can look after children more clearly to prevent some crimes.
Secondly, many yongsters can be influenced by gangsters in films. They watch them and become to do everything to be similar to the heroes of the crime films of 90th. So, as a result they committ some crimes. For solving this I suppose that parents should show only kind films to children since the early ages. When the child grows up, they want to watch only films which have some sence and which let them thinking after watching it. It will become their behaviour which was made by parents in childhood.
The last but not the least cause of this problem is some bad peers of children who do not have parents or their mothers are drug or alhogol addicted. As a result of the communacation with the friends like that, children become to be like them. They want to be a part of the team of that bad peers, so they do all like they. Furthermore, not only crimes are dangerous for them in this society. They also can start to dring alhogol or to take drugs since the early age of 15 or 16. To overcome and stop this trend, parents and techers should speak with children everyday. They should tell them all concequances of their bad deeds. Moreover, the important solution for preventing the communacation with bad peers can be the moving to some other town. So, choldren will try to start new life in new place.
To sum up I would like to say, that there are many solutions for overcoming this problem, but first of all, adults should understant the main reason why their children have committed the crime.",7

There is an infinite number of problems that can play the role of incentives. In this essay I would like to discuss some of the ways that can help to overcome this development.
First of all, speaking about my personal judgment, the main cause of discussed problem is problems in families. Sometimes teenagers face domestic violence that can affect various aspects of their life and, as a result, they consider such behaviour as normal and act accordingly not only at home. Our parents are the ones who are the role models for us and if they do not behave appropriately, their children would think that they should also behave as them.
Secondly, the underlying cause of teenagers' acts against the law is some violent games among peers. It is a common trait of young people to try to be cooler than everyone else. Some of them are stealing clothes in order to be in trend and that noone would banter them because of their appearence.
Speaking about ways that can help to overcome this problem, firstly, it is essential for parents to understand their significant role in developing their childrens' charachers. Some lectures can be provided for those adults who have children where this problem will be discussed. What is more, teenagers spend most of their time in schools. Therefore, teachers can influence them too. It is vital for young people to know that they should not listen to their peers as they are not role models for them. So this topic can be discussed on some seminars. Thus, from the first grade they will be aware of some problems that can raise, as the result, of bad behaviour.
Taking everything into consideration, there are numerous reasons why teenagers are involved in the crimes. Despite of this fact, some tactics can be deployed in order to bypass this development.",7

This essay argues that jail is not a decision of this problem; however, both viewes are considered.

First of all, the main way to prevent some society members from criminal deeds is education, because it affects a person's consciousness at first. To put it more precisely, if a human is tought that crimes, murders and other types of illegal actions entail only punishment they can one day be persuaded by this propositions. For instance, today many prisoners who have comitted crimes are tought by professional psychologists and the majority of them really changes their life style. Secondly, the punishment of crimes could be toughened up in order to keep at bay some dangerous for society's safety individuals. For intstance, in the USA no the long-term isolation (because a person in this case realizes that he or she will inevitably leave a jail in the future) but the highest form of punishment - kill - motivate people not to commit such deeds. It could be also added that the purpose of reduction crimes should affect not only educational and law systems but also all social spehres where inadequate or craving for money people are under control and observation. One convincing example is special places where criminals can realize their intensions not in a harmful way; for example, they can, being under control of doctors and policemen, take care about seniors or children.
On the other hand, prison in the best teacher to convince a criminal of his or her mistakes. As it is widely known, a person who is prisoned face a lot of obstacles such as pressure of other criminals, abuse, deficiency of food which could be taken by more popular and strong prisoned ones. To set an example, many criminalas spending at least a quarter of life in jail and suffering an infinite number of problems try to live a completely different life when they are free. Moreover, the fear of a long isolation from loved ones or family members and a singnificant lack of communication, what to a certain extant affects persons' mind, can persuade criminals to abandon the type of satisfying their financial or other needs.

To sum up, moder society is highly concerned about criminals' destiny and the problem of crimes reduction and mane measures are taken in this field. But I strongly believe that prison cannot provide society members' safety without additional attempts to improve this situation in many life spheres.",7
